  :End:
[[http://isync.sourceforge.net/][Mbsync]] and [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]] are great for syncing and handling IMAP email. I've now migrated 4 email addresses, including an old Yahoo account.

I wanted to mark all my Yahoo unread emails as read. Yahoo's webmail enables marking 500 emails at a time, making the process a little tedious.

[[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mu-discuss][Mu-discuss]] has a handy [[https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mu-discuss/zaA394sH1Ow/QSVPXS22BQAJ][thread]], highlighting that moving/renaming synced messages (in your local file system) would do the job. This worked well for me.

Let's do just that...

*WARNING:* Copy a small sample of your mails to a separate directory and run some trials until you feel comfortable.

Find your mail directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cd path/to/mail
#+END_SRC

Peek at the messages you'd like to mark unread:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ls -1 new/
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
  1529958027.57518_11.mbp,U=8415:2,

  1532464801.21057_2.mbp,U=9029:2,

Rename message files by appending "S" to their filename and moving from new/ to cur/ directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  for FILE in new/*; do mv "${FILE}" cur/$(basename "${FILE}")S; done;
#+END_SRC

We can verify the move.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ls -1 cur/
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
  1529958027.57518_11.mbp,U=8415:2,S

  1532464801.21057_2.mbp,U=9029:2,S

Let's sync the local changes.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mbsync -Va
#+END_SRC

...and we're done ;)

  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:
Retook running recently. Took the dust off my aria scale and used the opportunity to check out fitbit's API.

First register your app at [[https://dev.fitbit.com/apps/new][dev.fitbit.com/apps/new]] and get a client_id=AABBCC.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/fitbit-api-org-babel-and-gnuplot/fitbitapp.png]]

You'll also need your USER_ID, from your Fitbitx user profile.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/fitbit-api-org-babel-and-gnuplot/fitbituser.png]]

We'll also need a token. I used the [[https://dev.fitbit.com/build/reference/web-api/oauth2/][implicit grant flow]] URL in my browser and extracted access_token=TOKEN.

Now let's wire up two org source blocks to fetch the data and subsequently plot using gnuplot.

It's pretty neat. You can take the output from one source block and use it as input to another.

We use curl to fetch data from fitbit's API and pipe through [[https://stedolan.github.io/jq/][jq]] and sed to massage the output format into two columns.

*Note:* Before using gnuplot in org babel, you'll need to install the gnuplot package and add to babel languages.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package gnuplot :ensure t)

  (use-package ob
    :config
    (org-babel-do-load-languages
     'org-babel-load-languages
     '((gnuplot . t))))
#+END_SRC

#+NAME: weight-data

#+END_SRC

| 2018-07-10 |  64.22 |
| 2018-07-11 |  63.95 |

Now feed the two column data to gnuplot.

#+BEGIN_SRC gnuplot :var data=weight-data :exports code :file images/fitbit-api-org-babel-and-gnuplot/weight.png
reset
set title "My recent weight"
set xdata time
set timefmt '%Y-%m-%d'
set format x "%d/%m/%y"
set term png
set xrange ['2018-06-09':'2018-07-11']
plot data u 1:2 with linespoints title 'Weight in Kg'
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:images/fitbit-api-org-babel-and-gnuplot/weight.png]]

Fetching data and plotting through org babel and gnuplot is pretty sweet. I've barely scratched the surface. There's more at [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-gnuplot.html][Org-babel-gnuplot]] and [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-plot.html][Plotting tables in Org-Mode using org-plot]]. Either way, this is another Emacs super power to keep in the toolbox.

Narrowing utilities are a wonderful way of increasing productivity. I have a few workflows using Emacs's [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]] framework.

There are great productivity boosters like [[https://www.alfredapp.com/][Alfred]] and [[https://qsapp.com/][Quicksilver]] for macOS, with batteries included.

If you're a tinkerer, you'd enjoy the powerful [[http://hammerspoon.org/][Hammerspoon]]. Like elisp gluing all things Emacs, Hammerspoon uses Lua to glue all things macOS. You can build your own narrowing utilities using [[http://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/hs.chooser.html][chooser]] and a little Lua.

#+BEGIN_SRC lua
  local chooser = hs.chooser.new(function(choice)
        hs.alert.show(choice['text'])
  end)

  chooser:choices({
        {
           ["text"] = "Alfred",
           ["subText"] = "macOS only",
        },
        {
           ["text"] = "Quicksilver",
           ["subText"] = "macOS only",

        {
           ["text"] = "Hammerspoon",
           ["subText"] = "macOS only",
        },
        {
           ["text"] = "Emacs",
           ["subText"] = "is everywhere :)",
        },

Howard Abrams's post on [[http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/capturing-content.html][Capturing Content for Emacs]] inspired me to look at gluing Emacs and macOS to launch my own cross-platform narrowing utilities.

I've also taken this opportunity to look at Oleh Krehel's wonderful completion package: [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Ivy]]. We can use it to build a macOS narrowing utility.

Ivy is remarkably easy to use. Turns out, [[http://oremacs.com/swiper/#api][ivy-read]] is all you need. A simple Emacs completion can be accomplished with little elisp.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (ivy-read "Hello ivy: "
            '("One "
              "Two "
              "Three "
              "Four "))
#+END_SRC

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/emacs-utilities-for-your-os/simple_ivy.png]]

Pretty nifty. Let's make this completion more accessible from the rest of the OS. To do so, we create a separate Emacs frame and make it pretty. We also want it to interact with the OS. We'll use /ivy-read/'s /:action/ to invoke a tiny bit of AppleScript.

Oh and we'll also use some funny quotes to tease ourselves about our beloved editor.

So where's all this going? I wrote a utility to extract all links from [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenodium/xenodium.github.io/master/index.org][this page's org file]] and make them easily searchable from anywhere on macOS by invoking *⌥-W*.

The keys are bound using Lua, Hammerspoon, and emacsclient. This works well on macOS, but there are alternatives for other operating systems.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: trying-out-mu4e-with-mbsync
  :END:
The email fun in Emacs continues. After a few weeks since I [[#trying-out-mu4e-and-offlineimap][started using mu4e and offlineimap]], I'm sold. Both are awesome. [[http://isync.sourceforge.net/mbsync.html][Mbsync]] is an [[http://www.offlineimap.org/][offlineimap]] alternative. Despite resyncing all my mail, the transition was fairly smooth. Here's how...

*** Install isync (for mbsync)

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install isync
#+END_SRC

*** Configure mbsync

Mbsync uses ~~/.mbsyncrc~ for configuration. Migrating [[#trying-out-mu4e-and-offlineimap][~/.offlineimaprc]] to ~~/.mbsyncrc~ looks like:

#+BEGIN_SRC conf
  IMAPAccount Personal
  Host some.imap.host.com
  User your_user_name
  PassCmd "gpg --quiet --batch -d ~/.offlineimap_accountname.gpg"
  Port 993
  SSLType IMAPS
  AuthMechs Login
  CertificateFile  ~/.offlineimapcerts.pem
  # My IMAP provider doesn't handle concurrent IMAP commands.

*** No concurrent IMAP commands supported

My IMAP provider doesn't handle concurrent IMAP commands. [[https://kdecherf.com/blog/2017/05/01/mbsync-and-office-365/][mbsync and Office 365]] had the answer:

#+BEGIN_SRC conf
  PipelineDepth 1
#+END_SRC

*** Initial sync

Run initial from the command line sync:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mbsync -Va
#+END_SRC

While syncing my largest inbox, it sometimes received an unexpected EOF error:

#+BEGIN_SRC
  IMAP error: unexpected EOF from some.imap.host.com (1.2.3.4:993)
#+END_SRC

First few times, I restarted the syncing manually, but then used a loop to automatically restart it:

#+BEGIN_SRC
  while true; do mbsync -V Xenodium; sleep 5; done
#+END_SRC

*** Create mu index

Reindex using mu, but first remove existing index for offlineimap messages:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  rm -rf ~/.mu
#+END_SRC

Ok, do index now:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mu index --maildir=~/IMAP
#+END_SRC

*** Mu4e tweaks

The /get mail/ command should now point to mbsync.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (csetq mu4e-get-mail-command "mbsync -Va")
#+END_SRC

I had issues with duplicate IDs after moving and deleting messages from mu4e. [[http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/migrating-from-offlineimap-to-mbsync-for-mu4e/][Migrating from offlineimap to mbsync for mu4e]] had the answer:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

Managing Email from Emacs. Surely that's crazy-talk, but hey... let's give it a try.

*** Install offlineimap
Need to sync via imap. Use offlineimap. I'm on macOS, so homebrew is king for installing:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install offlineimap
#+END_SRC

Before can configure offlineimap, we'll need to handle a few things first.

*** Get a cert fingerprint

Use openssl for getting a certificate fingerprint. From offlineimap's [[http://www.offlineimap.org/doc/FAQ.html#view-the-fingerprint][FAQ:]]

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  SSL_CERT_DIR="" openssl s_client -connect imap.migadu.com:993 < /dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -fingerprint -noout -text -in /dev/stdin
#+END_SRC

Should give you something like:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  SHA1 Fingerprint=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:DD:FF:AA:00:AA:2A:AA:AA:AA:A8:20:80:AA:A2:AA
#+END_QUOTE

*** Encrypt password
Offlineimap can read passwords in plain text in its .offlineimaprc config file, but that's yuckie. Let's encrypt the password and use gnupg for that. Install it:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install gnupg
#+END_SRC

If you haven't already, generate a key

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  gpg --full-gen-key
#+END_SRC

Generate an offlineimap account password file.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  echo "YourPassword" | gpg --encrypt --recipient "Your Name" -o ~/.offlineimap_accountname.gpg
#+END_SRC

*** Python password  wrapper

Based on Fabian's [[https://f-koehler.github.io/posts/2015-03-17-offlineimap-msmtp-gnupg.html][Encrypt OfflineIMAP and msmtp password with GnuPG]], I created ~/.read_password.py with:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  import os
  import subprocess

  def read_password(path):
    return subprocess.check_output(["gpg", "--quiet", "--batch", "-d", os.path.expanduser(path)]).strip()
#+END_SRC

ps. Alternatively, see [[http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/the-homely-mutt/#retrieving-passwords][The homely Mutt]]'s section to store password in macOS's keychain.

*** Configure offlineimap

Offlineimap uses ~/.offlineimaprc for configuration. We now have all we need to put the configuration together:

#+BEGIN_SRC conf
[general]
accounts = Personal

# Load this python file.
pythonfile = ~/.read_password.py

[Account Personal]
localrepository = Personal-Local

remoterepository = Personal-Remote

# After syncing, let mu index it.
postsynchook = mu index --maildir ~/stuff/active/Mail

# Sync imap every 5 minutes.
autorefresh = 5

# Alternate between 10 quick syncs and full syncs.
quick = 10

[Repository Personal-Local]
type = Maildir
localfolders = ~/stuff/active/Mail/Personal

[Repository Personal-Remote]
type = IMAP
remotehost = some.imap.host.com
remoteuser = your_user_name

# Use function defined in .read_password.py to read the password.
remotepasseval = read_password("~/.offlineimap_personal_account_password.gpg")

# Use the SHA1 fingerprint retrieved with openssl.
cert_fingerprint = aabbccddeeddffaa00aa2aaaaaaaa82080aaa2aa
#+END_SRC

***** Cert file

You can use macOS's certificates from Keychain Access -> System Roots -> Certificates, select all, and ⌘-⇧-e (for export items). Save to ~/certs.pem and use offlineimap configutation:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
sslcacertfile = /path/to/certs.pem
#+END_QUOTE

Another option is executing lib/mk-ca-bundle.pl from curl's tarball to generate ca-bundle.crt, using certdata.txt from Mozilla's source tree.

*** Install mu4e
Manually modified mu4e recipe to pick up my Emacs binary. TIL about homebrew's edit command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew edit mu
#+END_SRC

Changed the one line:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
- ENV["EMACS"] = "no" if build.without? "emacs"
+ ENV["EMACS"] = "/Users/alvaro/homebrew/Cellar/emacs-plus/26.1-rc1_2/bin/emacs"
#+END_QUOTE

Finally installed mu4e:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install mu
#+END_SRC

*** Configure mu4e

Lastly, configure mu4e:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path
               (expand-file-name "~/homebrew/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu/mu4e"))

                    (mu4e-compose-format-flowed . nil)))
           (make-mu4e-context
            :name "domain2"
            :enter-func (lambda () (mu4e-message "Entering context myself@domain2.com"))

            :vars '((user-mail-address . "myself@domain2.com")
                    (user-full-name . "Álvaro Ramírez")
                    (mu4e-sent-folder . "/Domain2/Sent")
                    (mu4e-drafts-folder . "/Domain2/Drafts")
                    (mu4e-trash-folder . "/Domain2/Trash")
                    (mu4e-compose-signature . nil)
                    (mu4e-compose-format-flowed . nil))))))
#+END_SRC
*** Authinfo

Create an ~/.authinfo file for sendmail authentication with:

#+BEGIN_SRC
machine smtp.host1.com login account1@host1.com password somepassword1
machine smtp.host2.com login account2@host2.com password somepassword2
#+END_SRC

Encrypt ~/.authinfo with M-x epa-encrypt-file. Keep ~/.authinfo.gpg and delete ~/.authinfo.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
gpg: problem with the agent: Inappropriate ioctl for device
gpg: error creating passphrase: Operation cancelled
gpg: symmetric encryption of '[stdin]' failed: Operation cancelled
#+END_EXAMPLE

Basic installation required:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install gnupg
#+END_SRC

But worked around the error above by using pinentry-mac (UI), instead of Emacs prompts.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install pinentry-mac
#+END_SRC

Edited ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pinentry-program path/to/homebrew/bin/pinentry-mac

May need to kill gpg-agent to reload config.

I wrote about [[#search-bash-history-with-emacs-helm][searching bash history with Emacs Helm]] some time ago. Since then, I've learned about /completing-read/ to generically handle simple Emacs completions (very handy for supporting Helm, Ivy, and Ido completions).

Here's a simple way to combine /completing-read/ and the /compile/ command to enable fuzzy searching your compile history:

[[file:images/fuzzy-search-emacs-compile-history/fuzzy_compile.gif]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun ar/compile-completing ()
    "Compile with completing options."
    (interactive)
    (let ((compile-command (completing-read "Compile command: " compile-history)))
      (compile compile-command)
      (add-to-list 'compile-history compile-command)))

Can't miss out on all the new fun. Emacs 25 RC2 is out and lots of people already using it. Since I'm mostly on MacOS these days, installing via homebrew with --devel, gets you RC2:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install emacs --devel --with-cocoa --with-gnutls --with-librsvg --with-imagemagick
#+END_SRC

The only hiccup so far's been org mode failing to export, which was fixed by re-installing it (follow [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2015-08/msg00320.html][this thread]]).

* [2016-06-17 Fri] [[#emacs-and-emotional-vocab][#]] Emacs and emotional vocab
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: emacs-and-emotional-vocab
:END:
Having read [[http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/05/opinion/sunday/are-you-in-despair-thats-good.html][Are You in Despair? That’s Good]], I was encouraged to expand my emotional vocabulary. As a [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/play/zone.el][zone.el]] fan (checkout [[https://github.com/wasamasa/zone-nyan][nyan]], [[https://github.com/kawabata/zone-sl][sl]], and [[https://github.com/kawabata/zone-rainbow][rainbow]]), I looked into writing a zone [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/play/zone.el#L52][program]]. When /zone-when-idle/ is set, zone acts as a screensaver of sorts. We can use this to display random emotional vocab whenever Emacs is idle for a period of time. Let's get to it...

Zone keeps a list of programs to choose from when kicked off. Below is a basic /zone-hello/ program, along with an interactive command for previewing. Not much to these. The tiny program prepares the screen for zoning and inserts text while no input is pending.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun zone-hello ()
    (delete-other-windows)
    (setq mode-line-format nil)
    (zone-fill-out-screen (window-width) (window-height))
    (delete-region (point-min) (point-max))
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (while (not (input-pending-p))
      (insert "hello zone\n")
      (zone-park/sit-for (point-min) 0.2)))

  (defun zone-hello-preview ()
    (interactive)
    (let ((zone-programs [zone-hello]))
      (zone)))
#+END_SRC

Here's what /zone-hello/ looks like:

[[file:images/emacs-and-emotional-vocab/minimal-zone.gif]]

Back to improving our emotional vocabulary, we'll need a dictionary for our goal. A quick search yields a potential list of [[http://www.psychpage.com/learning/library/assess/feelings.html][words]]. We can use [[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/][WordNet]] to define them while offline. These two sources will do for now. We tie it all together in [[https://github.com/xenodium/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/ar/zone-words.el][zone-words.el]] and the resulting zone program looks as follow:

[[file:images/emacs-and-emotional-vocab/emotions.gif]]

UPDATE: Just came across [[http://blog.josephwilk.net/art/emacs-animation.html][Animations With Emacs]]. A post with awesome zone examples.

Step into a Viennese blast from the past. Beautiful setting and pleasant vibe. Ordered a dirty martini on the rocks, a bottle of Merlot, Käsespätzle (with bacon), and Wiener Schnitzel (with anchovy/capers/egg). All very tasty.

My girlfriend recently made a delicious chocolate fondant. Saving the [[http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/feb/10/how-cook-perfect-chocolate-fondants][The Guardian's recipe]]:
*** Ingredients (2 servings)
- 60g unsalted butter, cut into dice, plus extra to grease
- 1 tbsp cocoa powder
- 60g dark chocolate, broken into pieces
- 1 egg and 1 egg yolk
- 60g caster sugar
- 1 tbsp plain flour
*** Preparation
1. Pre-heat the oven to 200C if cooking immediately, and put a baking tray on the middle shelf. Butter the inside of 2 small ramekins or pudding moulds, and then put the cocoa in one and turn it to coat the inside, holding it over the second mould to catch any that escapes. Do the same with the other mould.
2. Put the butter and chocolate into a heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a pan of simmering water and stir occasionally until melted. Allow to cool slightly.
3. Vigorously whisk together the egg, yolk, sugar and a pinch of salt until pale and fluffy. Gently fold in the melted chocolate and butter, and then the flour. Spoon into the prepared moulds, stopping just shy of the top – at this point the mixture can be refrigerated until needed, or even frozen, as the puddings will not wait around once cooked.
4. Put on to a hot baking tray and cook for 12 minutes (14 if from cold, 16 if frozen) until the tops are set and coming away from the sides of the moulds. Leave to rest for 30 seconds and then serve in the ramekins or turn out on to plates if you're feeling confident – they're great with clotted cream or plain ice cream.

*** Anger
"I do get angry, but I feel angry with myself for it. Full conquest of anger is possible only through self-realization. We should love even those who have the worst opinion of us. This is ahimsa, the rest is only ignorance."
*** Bad handwriting
"I am now of opinion that children should first be taught the art of drawing before learning how to write. Let the child learn his letters by observation as he does different objectives, such as flowers, birds, etc., and let him learn handwriting only after he has learned to draw objects."
*** Conduct of the Ashram
"Service without humility is selfishness and egotism."
*** Eating
"There is a great deal of truth in the saying that man becomes what he eats. The grosser the food, the grosser the body."
*** Heart
"There are chords in every human heart. If we only know how to strike the right chord, we bring out the music."
*** Moral law
The law of truth and love.
*** Renouncing or forgoing
Nishkulanand sings: "Renunciation of objects, without the renunciation of desires, is short-lived, however hard you may try."
*** Silence

1. Block time away from reactive tasks (email).
2. Business = wasted energy.
3. Exercise, sleep, and 90 minute work bursts.
4. Incomplete tasks prompt healthy thinking out of context.
5. Time off or stepping back is invaluable.
6. Genuinely help were most successful/enjoyable.
7. Plan for saying no while highlighting priority and seeking feedback.
8. Measure important behavior change.

Following up from [[#change-emacs-shells-cwd-with-helm-projectile][changing CWD with helm projectile]], here's a way to search your bash history with helm:

Got a CD with my chest X-ray from the hospital. Was expecting a pdf or an image of sorts, but the CD content was rather different. For starters, it was targeted at Windows users (AUTORUN.INF, MediaViewerLauncher.EXE and a bunch of DLLs):

#+BEGIN_SRC text

  ./Worklist/Worklist.wl: application/octet-stream
#+END_SRC

I'm on a Mac, so most of these files were not useful to me. The more interesting files were IM_0001 and ED_0001 with "application/dicom" MIME type. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM][DICOM]] files stand for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine. How to view these on a Mac? [[http://www.osirix-viewer.com/Downloads.html][OsiriX viewer]] is an option. OsiriX, though on the heavy side (100.7MB download), it rendered the X-ray successfully.

[[file:images/view-dicom-files-from-your-x-ray/2015-12-03-osirix-x-ray-small.png]]

Unsurprisingly, ImageMagick's [[http://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php][convert]] utility also handles DICOM files. Converting to PNG worked well.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ convert ./DICOM/PAT_0000/STD_0000/SER_0001/OBJ_0001/ED_0001 ED_0001.png
#+END_SRC

[[file:images/view-dicom-files-from-your-x-ray/2015-12-03-imagemagick-x-ray-small.png]]


DICOM files also hold patient's metadata and optional reports. The file format is [[http://cabiatl.com/mricro/dicom/index.html][well known]]. OsiriX gives you access to it, but a few lines of python can also extract it for you. First install the [[https://github.com/darcymason/pydicom][pydicom]] package:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ sudo pip install pydicom
#+END_SRC

Running the python interpreter is enough to peak at the metadata:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  >>> import dicom
  >>> ds = dicom.read_file("./DICOM/PAT_0000/STD_0000/SER_0000/OBJ_0001/IM_0001")
  >>> ds

#+END_SRC

[[http://dcmtk.org/dcmtk.php.en][DCMTK]] is another alternative tool to extract DICOM metadata. The source is available and can be built:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ tar xf dcmtk-3.6.0.tar.gz
  $ cd dcmtk-3.6.0
  $ cmake .
  $ make
#+END_SRC

Or installed via homebrew:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ brew install dcmtk
#+END_SRC

DCMTK includes dcmdump. You can use it to dump DICOM files:

Dart SDK ships with an [[https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/master/pkg/analysis_server][analysis server]]. Very handy if you'd like to write a completion plugin for your favorite editor.

I've walked past this place many times and never noticed it. They serve a handful of items, but the grilled chilly squid skewers caught my attention. They're grilled, brushed with chilly sauce and finished with sprinkled sesame and cumin seeds. Super tasty.

*** Pancake + Crisp + Egg + Hot chillies = Jiān Bǐng 煎餅
I first had these delicious breakfast savory pancakes at a Beijing street food stall. Never expected to randomly find Jiān Bǐng in London. It's a crepe with an additional egg spread, hoisin sauce, chilly sauce, hot chillies, topped with spring onions and coriander, all wrapping a wonderfully crispy bread cracker. And.. it's awesome.

*** Tai Yaki
Chinatown Bakery is hard to miss. Pedestrian traffic slows down as we all fall under the spell of the Tai Yaki machine. This wonderful assembly line produces fish-shaped sweet waffles filled with custard. They are the perfect dessert after some savory street snacks. You can get a bag of 4 for £2.

*** All near each other
All these delights are within a stone's throw away from each other.

*** Useful?
Was this post useful to you? do [[https://twitter.com/xenodium/status/646101779281801216][reply]]!
*** Better suggestion?
London is full of overhyped, gimmicky, and unnecessarily expensive restaurants. Very few deliver truly awesome food (even those expensive ones). Got suggestions? I'd love to hear from you [[https://twitter.com/xenodium][@xenodium]].

*** Recommended? yep
[[http://www.lucky7london.co.uk][Lucky 7]] is a small nostalgic American diner on Westbourne Park road. I like the vibe, the space, and the unpretentious waiting staff. I go to Lucky 7 often enough, originally for the buttermilk pancakes, but the list of favorites on the menu keeps growing.

Smileys by [[https://openclipart.org/detail/219291/smile][w.dyer]].

*** Buttermilk Banana pancakes
These are my favorite pancakes in London by far. Banana buttermilk pancakes and a few free coffee refills usually sort me out until dinner time. Add a side of bacon if extra hungry. You probably don't need it though.

[[file:images/lucky-7-review/lucky-7-coffee.jpg]]
[[file:images/lucky-7-review/lucky-7-pancakes.jpg]]

*** Reuben sandwich
The reuben has been on Lucky 7's specials menu for months now. Not had many of these in London, but compared to The Brass Rail's, this reuben was a clear winner. The sandwich is huge and comes with fries. My girlfriend and I struggled to finish one between the two of us.

file:images/lucky-7-review/lucky-7-reuben-cross-section.jpg

*** Vanilla milkshake (add malt!)
This milkshake hits the spot every time, but it's filling. You almost have to decide between the shake and an actual meal. If you must have it, add malt. Sorry, no picture.
*** Huevos Rancheros
This is a breakfast dish I can equally make (better?) at home, but Lucky 7 wins hands down every time I'm feeling particularly lazy. Sorry, no picture.

I've loved my [[http://www.amazon.com/Soundmagic-PL30-In-Ear-Headphones/dp/B001MQ3CCO][Soundmagic PL30 in-ear headphones]]. They're relatively inexpensive, comfortable, and great for exercising (they stay in). Audio quality and bass have been good enough (I don't need much). Unfortunately, I've had two pairs of PL30's and both stopped working after a year or two. I'm replacing the last pair with [[http://www.amazon.co.uk/RHA-MA750-Isolating-In-Ear-Headphone-Black/dp/B00ELAM8LE][RHA's MA750]] (an upgrade, me hopes).

Other contenders considered: [[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Etymotic-Research-Portable-iPhone-Earphones-Black/dp/B000XPG2QI][Etymotic Research HF5]], and [[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Shure-SE215-In-Ear-Isolating-Earphones-Clear/dp/B004U9NH3E][Shure SE215]]. Also considered bluetooth alternatives like [[http://www.amazon.com/JayBird-BlueBuds-Sport-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B00AIRUOI8?][JayBird BlueBuds X]] and [[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Plantronics-BackBeat-Wireless-Earbuds-Frustration-Black/dp/B00DZTHW9U][Plantronics BackBeat GO 2]].

I'm somewhat nervous to pay more for a pair of headphones. Let's hope they don't meet the same unfortunate fate. We'll see.

There are three browser tabs continously used in my workflow: GMail, Google Calendar, and Google Play Music. I normally have many more tabs open, but these three I access periodically. As the number of open tabs increases, and I fail to cleanup, getting back to my usual three gets a little trickier.

So far, I've kept each of these services open in separate windows. But that doesn't always work. Click on any link in your inbox and you're back to playing cleanup. This is where [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site-specific_browser][site-specific browsers]] (SSB) can help.

[[https://github.com/dmarmor/epichrome][Epichrome]] enables you to build Chrome-based SSBs (on Mac OSX). Build an SSB for the usual suspects and easily jump to them using the app switcher.

UPDATE: Enable the Chrome extension to open URLs in default browser.

And choose the default browser to open URLs.

OK not quite, but having recently learned about [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Appending-Kills.html][C-M-w (append-next-kill)]], I used it in a keyboard macro to fish out matching lines. This is similar to [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Other-Repeating-Search.html][flush-lines]], except the kill ring is also populated. This is handy, if you need the flushed lines. Here's an example.

[[file:images/fishing-with-emacs/fishing.gif]]

Here's the equivalent in Emacs lisp:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun flush-kill-lines (regex)
    "Flush lines matching REGEX and append to kill ring.  Restrict to \
  region if active."
    (interactive "sFlush kill regex: ")
    (save-excursion
      (save-restriction
        (when (use-region-p)
          (narrow-to-region (point) (mark))
          (goto-char 0))
        (while (search-forward-regexp regex nil t)
          (move-beginning-of-line nil)

:END:
If you haven't bought [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/book][Mastering Emacs]] by [[https://twitter.com/mickeynp][Mickey Petersen]], you should. It's a wonderful source of Emacs tips. Having just finished the ebook on my Kindle, I was keen to go back and fish out some of that newly found wisdom. My immediate reaction was to figure out a way to make the ebook searchable from Emacs.

The ebook is available in epub and pdf format. Though Emacs's docview is super handy for viewing pdf's, searching didn't feel as comfortable as searching in org mode. The epub, on the other hand, proved useful. [[http://pandoc.org][Pandoc]] can easily convert from epub to org.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pandoc  --from=epub --to=org mastering-emacs.epub > mastering-emacs.org
#+END_SRC

After a some tidying (mostly removing BEGIN_HTML/END_HTML blocks and adding TITLE/AUTHOR), the resulting org file is surprisingly clean and easy to search/navigate. [[https://github.com/ShingoFukuyama/helm-swoop][helm-swoop]] and [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/blob/199b9feb396eedc0e502dd767b19060f7dc09f6a/helm-org.el][helm-org-in-buffer-headings]] are great for that.

If the current defun is actually a call to `defvar', then reset the

* [2015-04-23 Thu] [[#emacs-key-bindings-and-maps][#]] Emacs key bindings and maps
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: emacs-key-bindings-and-maps
:END:
*** based on [[http://www.masteringemacs.org/article/mastering-key-bindings-emacs][masteringemacs.org]].
*** bonus tip
prefix key, followed by c-h, lists keys in prefix.
*** keymap
maps key to action.
*** keymap found in buffer and most major modes.
*** keys
- undefined: self explanatory.
- prefix key: ie. c-x (part of complete key).
- complete key: complete input executes associated command.
*** mapping
- (define-key keymap key def): add to current buffer map.
- (local-set-key key command): add to active buffer (no map option).
- (local-unset-key key)
- (global-set-key key command): add to global keymap (all buffers).
- (global-unset-key key)
*** key codes
- kbd: macro transaltes human-readable key to emacs readable.
- function and navigation keys must be surrounded by <>.
- example: (kbd "c-c p") or (kbd "<f8>") of (kbd "<down>").
*** remapping
- use remap to replace mapping (ie. kill-line with my/kill-line).
- (define-key keymap [remap original-function] 'my-own-function).
*** reserved keys
- "c-c ?" generally reserved for you, but third party packages use it.
- function keys (ie. f1-f12).
- hyper and super (ancient).
*** lookup order
- in a nutshell: minor mode keys, local keys, global keys.
- full order:
  1. overriding-terminal-local-map: terminal-specific key binds.
  2. overriding-local-map: override all other local keymaps (avoid if possible).
  3. char property at point: useful for yasnippet.
  4. emulation-mode-map-alists: advanced multi-mode keymap.
  5. minor-mode-overriding-map-alist: minor modes in major modes.
  6. minor-mode-map-alist: as previous (preferred for minor modes) <-----
  7. current-local-map: buffers current local map.
  8. current-global-map: last place to look (ie. global).
*** mode hooks
- (local-set-key (kbd "c-c q") 'my-awesome-method)) in hook-method.
- for key-chord-define, use current-local-map.

- Prefer list comprehensions to filter.
- Prefer using separate modules over classes if only using for separation.
- Keep in mind: "eafp vs lbyl" (ie. just let it throw).
- Prefer exceptions over assertions.
- Throw ValueError for wrong input.
- Return explicit False if remaining case is always false.
