* [2020-05-22 Fri] Open Emacs elfeed links in the background

[[file:images/open-emacs-elfeed-links-in-background/background-browse.gif]]

Christopher Wellons's [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][elfeed]] is a wonderful Emacs rss reader. In Mike Zamansky's [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-72-customizing-elfeed/][Using Emacs 72 - Customizing Elfeed]] video, he highlights a desire to open elfeed entries in the background. That is, open the current rss entry (or selected entries) without shifting focus from Emacs to your browser. This behaviour is somewhat analogous to ⌘-clicking/ctrl-clicking on multiple links in the browser without losing focus.

I've been wanting elfeed to open links in the background for some time. Zamansky's post was a great nudge to look into it. He points to the relevant [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed/blob/58ab1f8bcc3014206db42a7a26f3120ba5de4ca6/elfeed-search.el#L783][elfeed-search-browse-url]] function, re-implemented to suit his needs. In a similar spirit, I wrote a function to open the current rss entry (or selected entries) in the background.

I'm running macOS, so I took a look at [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/d714aa753b744c903d149a1f6c69262d958c313e/lisp/net/browse-url.el#L1018  I ][browse-url-default-macosx-browser]] to get an idea of how URLs are opened. Simple. It let's macOS handle it via the "open" command, invoked through /start process/. Looking at open's command-line options, we find /--background/ which "does not bring the application to the foreground."

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  open --background http://xenodium.com
#+end_src

"b" is already bound to /elfeed-search-browse-url/, so in our snippet we'll bind "B" to our new background function, giving us some flexibility:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package elfeed
    :ensure t
    :bind (:map elfeed-search-mode-map
                ("B" . ar/elfeed-search-browse-background-url))
    :config
    (defun ar/elfeed-search-browse-background-url ()
      "Open current `elfeed' entry (or region entries) in browser without losing focus."
      (interactive)
      (let ((entries (elfeed-search-selected)))
        (mapc (lambda (entry)
                (assert (memq system-type '(darwin)) t "open command is macOS only")
                (start-process (concat "open " (elfeed-entry-link entry))
                               nil "open" "--background" (elfeed-entry-link entry))
                (elfeed-untag entry 'unread)
                (elfeed-search-update-entry entry))
              entries)
        (unless (or elfeed-search-remain-on-entry (use-region-p))
          (forward-line)))))
#+end_src

Maybe xdg-open does a similar thing on linux (I've not looked). Ping me if you have a linux solution and I can update the function.

Happy Emacsing.

ps. I noticed elfeed uses /browse-url-generic/ if /elfeed-search-browse-url/'s is invoked with a prefix. Setting  [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/d0e2a341dd9a9a365fd311748df024ecb25b70ec/lisp/net/browse-url.el#L534][browse-url-generic-program]] and [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/d0e2a341dd9a9a365fd311748df024ecb25b70ec/lisp/net/browse-url.el#L539][browse-url-generic-args]] to use background options may be a more generic solution. For now, a custom function does the job.

Shell one-liners are super handy for batch-processing files. Say you'd like to convert a bunch of images from HEIC to jpg, you could use something like:

#+begin_src sh
  for f in *.HEIC ; do convert "$f" "${f%.*}.jpg"; done
#+end_src

Save the one-liner (or memorize it) and pull it from your toolbox next time you need it. This is handy as it is, but [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][Emacs dired]] is just a file-management powerhouse. Its /dired-map-over-marks/ function is just a few elisp lines away from enabling all sorts of batch processing within your dired buffers.


Dired already enables selecting and deselecting files using all sorts of built-in mechanisms ([[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Marks-vs-Flags.html][dired-mark-files-regexp]], [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired-and-Find.html][find-name-dired]], etc) or wonderful third-party packages like Matus Goljer's [[https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks][dired-filters]].

Regardless of how you selected your files, here's a snippet to run ImageMagick's [[https://imagemagick.org/script/convert.php][convert]] on a bunch of selected files:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

The snippet can be shorter, but wouldn't be as friendly. We ask users to provide desired image format, spawn separate processes (avoids blocking Emacs), and generate a basic report. Also adds support for Windows.

Connecting and disconnecting bluetooth devices on macOS is fairly simple: use the menu bar utility.

[[file:images/emacs-connect-my-bluetooth-speaker/macos-menu.png]]

/But could we make it quicker from our beloved editor?/

Turns out with a little elisp glue, we can fuzzy search our Bluetooth devices and toggle connections. We can use [[https://twitter.com/_abo_abo][Oleh Krehel's]] [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy-read]] for fuzzy searching and [[https://twitter.com/lap_felix][Felix Lapalme]]'s nifty [[https://github.com/lapfelix/BluetoothConnector][BluetoothConnector]] to list devices and toggle Bluetooth connections.

As a bonus, we can make it remember the last selected device, so you can quickly toggle it again.

- 500g of flour.

Gradually add flour to the yeast and water mix, using the bottom of a spoon to work it until smooth (no lumps). The dough will be very sticky at first. Stay faithful to the spoon. It'll work. BBC's [[http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200415-how-to-make-pizza-like-a-neapolitan-master][How to make pizza like a Neapolitan master]] has a great demo. I followed the dough technique.

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/g3nsgg/mumu4e_14_has_been_released/][mu/mu4e 1.4 is out]]. About a week ago, I built and installed its [[https://github.com/djcb/mu/releases/tag/1.3.10][pre-release version (1.3.10)]] and noted [[http://xenodium.com/building-mumu4e-on-macos/][build steps on macOS]]. It's been working great for me. Today, I updated to 1.4.

I was keen to try the new release out. I had been experiencing a short delay immediately after syncing/indexing mail. An initial investigation pointed to contact syncing, but I didn't dig further. The 1.4 release notes had a promising entry:

#+begin_quote
  In many cases, `mu4e' used to receive /all/ contacts after each indexing operation; this was slow for some users, so we have updated this to /only/ get the contacts that have changed since the last round.
#+end_quote

After upgrading. The delay is gone for me \o/

*Note*: there are a few config tweaks needed for the 1.4 upgrade, but these are well-documented in the [[https://github.com/djcb/mu/releases/tag/1.4][release notes]]. For me, it primarily consisted of:

- Swapping elisp /mu4e-maildir/ var for /mu init --maildir path/to/local/IMAP/.
- Swapping elisp /mu4e-user-mail-address-list/ for /mu init --my-address address1@domain.com --my-address address2@domain.com/.
- Disabling /mu4e-maildirs-extension/ (not yet compatible with mu 1.4). No issues here, since I hardly ever look at the /mu4e-main/ buffer. I have global binding to my unread messages that looks a little something like this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ar/mu4e-view-unread-messages ()
    (interactive)
    (mu4e-headers-search-bookmark (concat "flag:unread AND "
                                          "flag:unread AND "
                                          "NOT flag:trashed AND "
                                          "(maildir:/box1/INBOX OR "
                                          "maildir:/box2/INBOX)")))

I'm a fan of Magnar Sveen's [[https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el][multiple cursors]] Emacs implementation. It's just so fun to use and works very well with commands bound to my favorite keys.

Every now and then I'd like to execute extended commands on all cursors, but they have no keys bound to them. If you're an [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy/counsel]] fan like me (and all packages by [[https://oremacs.com/about/][Abo Abo]]), you use /counsel-M-x/ to invoke commands. However, /counsel-M-x/ doesn't support multiple cursors out of the box. Luckily, this is Emacs and we can fix that...

Back in December 2019, I made a note to revisit [[https://www.reddit.com/user/snippins1987/][u/snippins1987]]'s weekly tip to pair [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/eeyhdz/weekly_tipstricketc_thread/fch1bkv?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x][helm-M-x with multiple cursors]].

** Soak beans (overnight)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       AACE1E97-D927-41B4-848B-E9F1ED28E8F1
:END:

- 1 cup of rajmah (kidney beans).
- 2 cups of sabut urad (black lentils).

Place the beans in a bowl with plenty of water. The beans will soak it up so ensure there's enough.

** Cooking the beans
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0D7866D3-5CCB-4ABC-BDF1-B0A4CA14DF21
:END:

- 3 liters of water.
- 1 cinamon stick.
- 1 tablespoon of turmeric.
- 2 bay leaves.

Drain the beans and combine new ingredients into a pot. Bring to a boil and simer for 1.5 hours. Check beans aren't firm (give 'em a try'). If so extend another 15-30 mins.

** Prepare paste
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5C6569A2-4E26-4DB8-A3E3-366032FC7386
:END:

- 1 large onion.
- 6 garlic cloves.
- 2 tomatoes.

Put through blender (with choppin pulse) or food processor until you get a paste.

** Golden paste
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       322E4961-F550-42EF-8287-F2C7BD0E64DD
:END:

- Paste.
- 3 tablespoons of butter.
- 1 tablespoon of cumin seeds.
- 1 tablespoon of coriander powder.
- 1 tablespoon of chilly powder (or less to make milder).
- 1 fresh red hot pepper (find one with medium heat level) chopped.
- 1 tablespoon of cumin powder.
- 1/4 cup of water.
- 3/4 tablespoon of salt.

Heat up the butter (medium heat) and brown the cumin seeds (maybe 30 seconds). Add the paste from previous step. Cook for about 4 minutes or until golden. Add the remaining ingredients in step (except water) and cook for another 30 seconds. Add the water and salt and mix to make more fluid and remove from heat.

Quickly finding related built-in elisp functions (without prefixes) can sometimes take a little poking around.

Some modern and predictable built-in exceptions I now reach out to are:

- [[https://nicolas.petton.fr/ressources/emacsconf2015/][map.el]] for key/values, alists, hash-tables and arrays (built-in as of Emacs 25.1).
- [[https://nicolas.petton.fr/ressources/emacsconf2015/][seq.el]] for alist, hash-tables and array manipulation (built-in as of Emacs 25.1).
- [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/emacs-lisp/subr-x.el][subr-x.el]] has a handful of string functions (built-in as of Emacs 24.4).
- [[https://endlessparentheses.com/new-on-elpa-and-in-emacs-25-1-let-alist.html][let-alist.el]] wonderful syntax for alists, great for json (built-in as of Emacs 25.1).

If you don't mind reaching out to third-party libs (you likely have some of these already installed), here are some modern, predictable, and well-documented ones that always get me out of trouble:

- [[https://github.com/magnars/s.el#functions][s.el]] string manipulation.
- [[https://github.com/rejeep/f.el][f.el]] file/path handling.
- [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el#functions][dash.el]] for lists.
- [[https://github.com/Wilfred/ht.el][ht.el]] for hashtables.
- [[https://github.com/alphapapa/ts.el][ts.el]] for date and time.

I'm happy with built-ins like map.el, seq.el, and let-alist.el. subr-x.el is also pretty nice, although not as full-featured as third-party s.el.

Am I missing out on other modern built-ins or third-party libraries?

UPDATE: Added a handful of newly discovered libraries plus [[https://twitter.com/dmartincy/status/1241444701754085383?s=20][suggestions by Daniel Martín]] (thanks!). Not tried any of these myself.

While the wonderful [[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens][smartparens]] gives Emacs pair-matching powers, it doesn't automatically indent between pairs (out of the box anyway).

Luckily, smartparens does provide /sp-local-pair,/ which enables us to achieve a similar goal.

With a short snippet, we can autoindent between {}, [], and () when pressing return in-between.

My Honeywell CM927 thermostat's screen had been getting progressively worse over the last year. As of late, the screen was of little use.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/fixing-honeywell-cm927-dead-screens/before.png]]

A random search yielded the [[https://www.homeownershub.com/uk-diy/honeywell-cm927-lcd-screen-fail-common-1058940-.htm][Honeywell CM927 LCD screen fail - common?]] thread, with a promising comment by Phil:

#+begin_quote
  "Strip the unit and remove the circuit board (just a few plastic clips, no screws). Remove the LCD assembly from the circuit board (more plastic clips and an eight pin push connection). Removed the LCD unit from the clear plastic housing (more plastic clips). Finally heat up the plastic ribbon where it is stuck to the circuit board (hair dryer will do trick) and then firmly press it onto the circuit board... probably worth doing this several times; in effect you are remating the ribbon to the circuit board by softening the adhesive. Put it all back together and it should be working again."
#+end_quote

Phil's instructions were great. There's also a super handy video by [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3Dbv6X-_7fCfa4AvsxK_zw][El Tucan]], also [[https://www.homeownershub.com/uk-diy/honeywell-cm927-lcd-screen-fail-common-1058940-3.htm][linked by Stevie]].

Heating up the plastic ribbon and pressing it onto the circuit board did the trick for me. Took a few tries for all segments to appear, but the screen is looking great again.

Thank you Internet strangers! :)

Today, I passed the [[https://www.gov.uk/life-in-the-uk-test][Life in the UK test]]. Wasn't quite sure how to study for it. During my commutes, I listened to the [[https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Life-in-the-UK-2019-Test-Contains-the-Official-Course-300-Practice-Questions-Audiobook/B07VD9SR3L][Life in the UK 2019 Test audio book]].

A friend recommended [[https://lifeintheuktestweb.co.uk][lifeintheuktestweb.co.uk]]. Overall, I found their practice tests very useful. Taking a bunch tests helped me internalize the material.

Took some notes along the way (mostly data with years attached) and dumped it into an [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Built_002din-Table-Editor.html#Built_002din-Table-Editor][org table]]. This helped me form a mental timeline.

*NOTE:* /These tables alone are *not* comprehensive enough to prepare for the exam. You'll need to know additional information without dates attached./

Over at [[http://wizardzines.com][wizardzines.com]], [[https://jvns.ca][Julia Evans]] authors wonderful zines on topics like git, networking, linux, command-line utilities, and others. Some zines are paid. Some are free. No affiliation here, just a fan.

A little while ago, Julia [[https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1192304892435738624][tweeted]] about a utility she's building to view her original comics on similar topics. I instantly thought it'd be a fun tool to implement for Emacs [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html][eshell]].

Since then, I subscribed to [[https://wizardzines.com/saturday-comics/][wizardzines.com/saturday-comics]] and received a few comics (awk, tar, and bash tricks). I saved them locally (using topic name and dropping file extensions).

#+begin_src sh :exports both
  ls -1 ~/Downloads/wizardzines-comics/
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

| bash |
| tar  |

By no means battle-tested, but here's an elisp snippet defining the /ecomic/ command. It displays inlined comics in the handy eshell.

The [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][counsel]] family of Emacs search commands are great for searching the filesystem. More specifically, /counsel-rg/, /counsel-ag/, and /counsel-pt/, which use the popular [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]], [[https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher][silver searcher]], and [[https://github.com/monochromegane/the_platinum_searcher][platinum searcher]] utilities.

counsel-rg is my default searcher. It returns results quickly, with live updates as I tweak the search query.

Up until recently, my queries typically matched text in files only. This works great, but every so often I wished I could amend the query to include (or exclude) results matching specific file /names/. Turns out, you can prepend the search query with additional switches using the "--" separator.

The switches are usually utility-specific, but if we wanted to keep results from file names matching a glob, we can prepend the ripgrep query with something like /"--glob Make* --"/ or the shorter version /"-g Make* --"/.

rg: -g Make* -- install

Back in 2015, I bound the "<" key to a hydra for quickly inserting org blocks. The idea came from Oleg's post on [[https://oremacs.com/2015/03/07/hydra-org-templates/][org-mode block templates in Hydra]]. The suggested binding settled in my muscle memory without much effort.

Fast forward to Febrary 2019. I replaced the hydra with /[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Easy-templates.html][org-insert-structure-template]]/ when /org-try-structure-completion/ was removed from org mode. No biggie, as I kept the same binding to "<" and hardly noticed the change.

Since my primary use-case for easy templates is inserting [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Working-with-source-code.html][source blocks]], I was keen to expedite choosing the source language as well as inserting the source block itself.

Writing a small [[https://company-mode.github.io/][company mode]] completion backend fits my primary use-case pretty well.

[[https://twitter.com/camdez][Cameron Desautel]] has a great post on [[https://engineering.collbox.co/post/working-faster-in-emacs-by-reading-the-future/][Working Faster in Emacs by Reading the "Future"]], highlighting /M-n/'s usefulness for inserting minibuffer default values.

Invoking /M-n/ in /shell-command/'s prompt is handy for quickly getting the current buffer's file name. This works great for one-off shell commands like /"chmod +x script.sh"/ or /"tidy -xml -i -m data.xml"/. Unfortunately, these commands aren't easily reusable from /shell-command/'s minibuffer history, since it'll keep hardcoded file names.

There's likely existing built-in functionality or a more elaborate package for this, but advising /read-shell-command/ enables us to write more reusable commands like /"chmod +x $f"/ or /"tidy -xml -i -m $f"./ We merely replace /$f/ with /(buffer-file-name)/, and let everything else continue as usual.

It's worth mentioning that searching minibuffer history is pretty simple when leveraging [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][counsel]] to fuzzy search (via /counsel-minibuffer-history/, bound to /C-r/ by default).

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/more-reusable-emacs-shell-command-history/richer-shell-command-history.gif]]

On a final note, searching minibuffer history for cache hits is way more useful with richer history content. Be sure to save minibuffer history across Emacs sessions and increase /shell-command-history/ using the built-in [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SaveHist][savehist-mode]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

Emacs [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][swiper]] is awesome. I bound /swiper-isearch/ to /C-s/. Also a big fan of [[https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el][multiple cursors]]. I use it regularly (it's fun).

I had totally missed Ole's post back in 2015: [[https://oremacs.com/2015/10/14/swiper-mc/][A simple multiple-cursors extension to swiper]]. Turns out, swiper has multiple cursors support out of the box (bound to /C-7/ by default). Yay!

UPDATE: Thanks to [[https://irreal.org/blog/?p=8370][irreal's post]], please remember to add /swiper-mc/ to /mc/cmds-to-run-once/ list (or things won't work as expected). This typically happens interactively when you invoke C-7 the first time around. Make sure you answer "n" when you see a prompt like:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/emacs-swiper-and-multiple-cursors/swiper-mc-no.png]]

If you happen to choose "y" by mistake, take a look at *~/.emacs.d/.mc-lists.el* to correct it. Remove /swiper-mc/ from /mc/cmds-to-run-for-all/
 and add it to /mc/cmds-to-run-once/. Invoke /m-x eval-buffer/ to reset the values and you're good to go.

  Needed to rewrite the date format in a couple of csv columns. Emacs multiple cursors helps here, but needed a function to parse and reformat the dates themselves.

  I can likely reformat dates using the built-in /parse-time-string/ and /format-time-string/ functions, but hey why not give the [[https://github.com/alphapapa/ts.el][ts.el]] library a try...

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ar/region-to-timestamp ()
    "Convert date like \"29 Apr 2019\" to \"2019-04-29\"."
    (interactive)
    (let ((date (ts-parse (buffer-substring
                           (region-beginning)
                           (region-end)))))
      (delete-region (region-beginning)
                     (region-end))
      (insert (ts-format "%Y-%m-%d" date))))
#+end_src

Bound the new function to a temporary keybinding, so I can invoke from multiple cursors:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (bind-key "M-q" #'ar/region-to-timestamp)
#+end_src

and voila!

Emacs [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]] is a powerful directory browser/editor. By default, it shows lots of handy file and directory details.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/showhide-emacs-dired-details-in-style/dired.png]]

I typically prefer hiding file and directory details until I need them. The built-in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Misc-Dired-Features.html][dired-hide-details-mode]] makes this easy with the "(" key toggle. Coupled with [[https://twitter.com/sanityinc][Steve Purcell]]'s [[https://github.com/purcell/diredfl][diredfl]] (for coloring), it strikes a great user experience.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/showhide-emacs-dired-details-in-style/diredfl.gif]]

With a short snippet, you can also show/hide dired details in style:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package dired
      :hook (dired-mode . dired-hide-details-mode)
      :config
      ;; Colourful columns.
      (use-package diredfl
        :ensure t
        :config
        (diredfl-global-mode 1)))
  #+end_src

*UPDATE:* Thanks to [[https://twitter.com/dmartincy][Daniel Martín]], who [[https://twitter.com/dmartincy/status/1180512330288975872][pointed me]] to [[https://github.com/clemera/dired-git-info][dired-git-info]]. This package adds git logs to dired file and directory details.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 90% :height 90%

Binding /dired-git-info-mode/ to ")" is a nice complement to /dired-hide-details-mode/'s "(" binding.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp

  :END:
The first time I saw [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Wdired.html][wdired]] in action, it blew my mind. wdired makes [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html#Dired][dired]] (directory editor) buffers writeable, so you can edit them like any other Emacs buffer. You can subsequently use all your favorite file-editing tricks to rename files (amongst other things). You can see it in action at the end of [[http://emacsrocks.com/e16.html][Emacs Rocks episode 16]].

When combining [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired-and-Find.html][find-dired]] with wdired, one can easily find matching files and quickly batch rename them using something like [[https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el][multiple cursors]] or [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Keyboard-Macros.html][keyboard macros]]. I've been a fan of the /find-dired/ -> /dired-toggle-read-only/ -> /mc/mark-all-like-this/ workflow for quite some time, but I always wished I could adjust /find-dired/ queries a little quicker by getting immediate feedback.

Completion frontends like [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]] and [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]] are perfect for getting this kind of immediate feedback. Peeking into ivy's [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/blob/master/counsel.el][counsel source]], I borrowed some ideas to glue counsel-style narrowing on a find command, which I can easily translate to a writeable dired buffer for all that joyful-mutiple-cursor-editing experience.

  :PUBDATE:  <2020-05-22 Fri 16:43>
  :END:
When I'm not using an automatic code formatter (ie. clang-format, gofmt, etc.), I often find myself using Emacs region marking commands like /mark-defun/, /er/expand-region/, and /mark-whole-buffer/ prior to pressing <tab>, which is bound to /indent-for-tab-command/.

This is all working as expected: the selection gets indented and the point is left in the current location.

Say we have the following snippet we'd like to indent.

[[file:images/mark-region-indent-restore-location/before.png]]

Mark region with C-M-h (mark-defun)

[[file:images/mark-region-indent-restore-location/selection.png]]

Indent with <tab> (indent-for-tab-command)

[[file:images/mark-region-indent-restore-location/basic-indent.png]]

We're done. The selected function is now indented as expected.

But... I always wished the point returned to the location prior to initiating the region-marking command, in this case /mark-defun/.

In short, I wish the point had ended in the following location.

[[file:images/mark-region-indent-restore-location/smart-indent.png]]

I'm not aware of an existing package that helps with this, so here's a tiny minor mode (divert-mode) to help with restoring point location after indenting a region. The /diverted-events/ variable can be used to track specific region selecting commands and associate breadcrumb functions to replace the point location as needed.

  This one's been bugging me for a while. On macOS, Emacs automatically focuses (raises) other frames when one is closed.

[[file:images/no-emacs-frame-refocus-on-macos/before.gif]]

  This has the unfortunate side-effect that I could be moved from one macOS desktop/space to another when closing an Emacs frame.

  Finally managed do something about it. Since I install Emacs on macOS via homebrew, a +[[https://github.com/xenodium/homebrew-emacs-plus/commit/79a8e98b222fa262746f6db620ddd1fdb151ece9][small patch on emacs-plus recipe]]+ [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/pull/122/commits/71bf246930bfedb337bcc0e21587ccbbb917e5bf][small patch on emacs-plus recipe]] did the job.

[[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Ivy]] is great. I've been meaning to figure out a way to swap sources while running ivy. This would enable me to cycle through different sources using the existing search parameters.

At first look, /'ivy-set-sources/ seemed like the right choice, but it's used during setup to agregate sources. Subsequent /'ivy-set-sources/ calls are ignored during an /'ivy-read/ session.

There's an ivy [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/issues/606][feature request]] over at github with a similar goal in mind. Although the feature is not yet supported, there's a handy suggestion to use /'ivy-quit-and-run/ to quit the current command and run a different one.

With /'ivy-quit-and-run/ in mind, we can write our /'ar/ivy-read/ function to take a list of sources and add a little logic to cycle through them using a keybiding, in my case <left> and <right>.

Emacs.app was installed to:
  /Users/some-user/homebrew/Cellar/emacs-plus/26.1

To link the application to default Homebrew App location:
  brew linkapps
or:
  ln -s /Users/some-user/homebrew/Cellar/emacs-plus/26.1/Emacs.app /Applications

--natural-title-bar option was removed from this formula, in order to
  duplicate its effect add following line to your init.el file
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-transparent-titlebar . t))
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-appearance . dark))
or:
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-transparent-titlebar . t))
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-appearance . light))

If you are using macOS Mojave, please note that most of the experimental
options are forbidden on Mojave. This is temporary decision.


To have launchd start d12frosted/emacs-plus/emacs-plus now and restart at login:
  brew services start d12frosted/emacs-plus/emacs-plus
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:

  :END:
Used my phone to take a handful of photos of an article from a magazine. Wanted to convert the images to a searchable pdf on macOS.

This was straightforward, having [[http://xenodium.com/trying-out-tesseract][already installed tesseract]].

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  for i in IMG_3*.jpg; do echo $i; tesseract $i $(basename $i .tif) pdf; done
#+END_SRC

Should now have a handful of OCR'd pdfs:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results verbatim :exports both
  ls *.jpg.pdf
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: IMG_3104.jpg.pdf
: IMG_3105.jpg.pdf
: IMG_3106.jpg.pdf
: IMG_3107.jpg.pdf

Finally, join all pdfs into one. Turns out macOS has a handy python script already installed. We can use it as:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  /usr/bin/python "/System/Library/Automator/Combine PDF Pages.action/Contents/Resources/join.py" -o joined.pdf IMG_*pdf
#+END_SRC

ps. [[https://pdfgrep.org][pdfgrep]] is great for searching pdfs.

  :END:
Wanted to send a pdf to my kindle for some holiday reading. You can easily do this by emailing the pdf to your kindle-bound email address.

Now, I typically attach files when composing mu4e emails by using /mml-attach-file/, which attaches the file using /<#part>...<#/part>/. However, the Amazon service did not find the attached pdf, so no pdf was added to my Kindle.

Fortunately, I found a handy [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/97abs7/anyone_uses_mu4e_to_send_mobi_files_to_kindle][Reddit thread, leding me to a working solution]]. Wrapping the part using /<#multipart type=mixed>...<#/multipart>/ did the job, using /mml-insert-multipart/, followed by /mml-attach-file/.

Resulting attachment should look something like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  <#multipart type=mixed>
  <#part type="application/pdf" filename="/path/to/file.pdf" disposition=attachment>
  <#/part>
  <#/multipart>
#+END_EXAMPLE

I should add a convenience elisp function for this, but that's for another time...

"Do-what-I-mean" (DWIM) functions enable us to introduce new Emacs powers to existing workflows without incurring the typical cost of remembering multiple related functions or introducing yet another key binding. DWIM functions invoke other functions, based on current context.

I wanted a small tweak in Ivy's /`minibuffer-keyboard-quit'/ invocation, commonly invoked via /C-g/ key binding:

1. If we have text selected in minibuffer, deselect it.
2. If we have any text in minibuffer, clear it.
3. If no text in minibuffer, quit.

Added /`ar/ivy-keyboard-quit-dwim'/ for this purpose. Binding it to C-g in /ivy-minibuffer-map/:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package ivy
    :ensure t
    :bind (:map ivy-minibuffer-map
                ("C-g" . ar/ivy-keyboard-quit-dwim))
    :config
    (defun ar/ivy-keyboard-quit-dwim ()
      "If region active, deactivate. If there's content, clear the minibuffer. Otherwise quit."
      (interactive)
      (cond ((and delete-selection-mode (region-active-p))
             (setq deactivate-mark t))
            ((> (length ivy-text) 0)
             (delete-minibuffer-contents))

[[https://twitter.com/twostraws][Paul Hudson's]] [[https://twitter.com/twostraws][tweet]] introduced me to Swift's multiline string indentation control using closing quotes. Neat!

Being an org-mode fan, I thought I'd give Swift multiline strings a try using Org [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html][Babel's]] [[https://github.com/zweifisch/ob-swift][ob-swift]]. I get to verify it and document at the same time. Win.

Swift org mode source blocks (ie. BEGIN_SRC/END_SRC) can be added as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC org :exports src
  ,#+BEGIN_SRC swift :exports both
    print("""
         Hello World
    """)

    print("""
         Hello World
         """)
  ,#+END_SRC

  ,#+RESULTS:
  :      Hello World
  : Hello World
#+END_SRC

By pressing /C-c C-c/ anywhere in the code block, the snippet is executed and its output captured in the /RESULT/ block. Super handy for quickly trying out snippets and keeping as future reference.

As a bonus, the above blocks can be exported to HTML ([[https://orgmode.org/manual/Exporting.html][amongst other formats]]). With some [[https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/search?q=org-html-head-extra&unscoped_q=org-html-head-extra][styling]], it looks as follows:

I seem to be more efficient in getting through rss feeds by individually browsing through related content. That is, I can get through all Emacs entries a lot faster if I look at Emacs content exclusively, instead of mixing with say BBC news. [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][Elfeed]] filters are great for filtering related content.

I wanted a way to easily switch through my typical categories of related content by quickly changing elfeed filters using a completion framework.

Emacs's [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Minibuffer-Completion.html][completing-read]] plays nicely with your favorite completing framework (mine is [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]]). With a couple of functions, we can get Emacs to ask us for the filtering category using human-readable options and quickly presenting related content. Binding the new functionality to <tab> is working well for me.

We don't actually need two functions, but /ar/elfeed-filter-results-count/ enables us to list only those feeds that actually have new content. The list will shrink as we get through our content. When no content is left, we get a little celebratory message.

It's been roughly 5 months since [[http://xenodium.com/#trying-out-mu4e-and-offlineimap][my mu4e email migration]]. Happy with my choice. [[http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][Mu4e]] is awesome.

I now have 4 email accounts managed by mu4e, and unfortunately receiving lots of junk mail.

I regularly peek at junk folders for false positives and delete junk email permanently. I've been wanting a quick way to glance at junk mail and easily delete page by page.

Deleting emails page by page is not supported in mu4e by default. /Fortunately, this is Emacs and we can change that™./

There's a handy package by Roland Walker called [[http://github.com/rolandwalker/window-end-visible][window-end-visible]]. We can use it to select mu4e emails by page and subsequently glue it all together to enable deleting emails by page.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

  (defun ar/mu4e-delete-page ()

Having recently read [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Transforming-Relationship-Achieving-Financial-Independence/dp/0143115766/][Your Money or Your Life]], I've been cutting down on personal expenses wherever possible. Specially recurring expenses which include monthly charges from VPS hosting. Let's reduce those charges...

My VPS needs are fairly small (mostly hobby and tinkering). [[https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7579034][Vultr]]† has a plan for $2.50/month (not seen anything cheaper). The caveat for the price, you get ipv6 access only (ie. 0000:1111:2222:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888).

So far so good, but my ISP doesn't yet support ipv6:

#+END_SRC

Fortunately, we can still work with ipv6 by using a tunnel (TIL about [[https://tunnelbroker.net][Hurricane Electric's tunnel broker]]). After signing up and creating a tunnel, they conveniently show you "Example Configurations" from the "Tunnel Details" menu. In my case, macOS:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ifconfig gif0 create
  ifconfig gif0 tunnel <ipv4 client broker IP or DCHP internal IP> <ipv4 server IP>
  ifconfig gif0 inet6 <ipv6 client broker IP> <ipv6 server IP> prefixlen 128
  route -n add -inet6 default <ipv6 server IP>
#+END_SRC

Note: If behind router, use the DHCP internal IP.

After configuring with ifconfig, all is good. Yay!

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ ping6 0000:1111:2222:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888

#+END_SRC

I'm an ipv6 noob. I mostly need ssh access. My typical usages need small tweaks.

For ssh:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ssh -6 username@0000:1111:2222:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888
#+END_SRC

For scp:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  scp -6 file.txt username@\[0000:1111:2222:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888\]:/remote/dir/

  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Imenu.html][imenu]] navigation is one of those Emacs gems I didn't discover until much later on. It does what you'd expect in all types of modes. In rare instances, I've found specific modes missing imenu support. Fortunately, this is Emacs and you can fix that.

  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html][Eshell]] has a handy feature to jump back and forth over previous prompts using /M-x eshell-previous-prompt (C-c C-p)/ and /M-x eshell-next-prompt (C-c C-n)/. Upon learning about these two functions, my immediate reaction was to try imenu. Surprisingly, it didn't "just work\n", but a tiny bit of elisp brought balance back to the Emacs universe.

  In an eshell mode hook function, one can set the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Imenu.html#index-imenu_002dgeneric_002dexpression-2058][imenu-generic-expression]] to help it find your favorite prompt:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-local imenu-generic-expression
                    '(("Prompt" " $ \\(.*\\)" 1)))
#+END_SRC

  Ah it's the little things...

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/imenu-on-emacs-eshell/eshell-imenu.gif]]

ps. If wondering why my imenu experience looks a little different, that's because I'm using Abo Abo's wonderful [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][counsel]] and /M-x counsel-semantic-or-imenu/.

I've grown accustomed to M-r bindings to search Emacs history. Been wanting similar functionality to search commit message history. Turns out /log-edit-comment-ring/ has some of my local commit message history. Feeding it to /completing-read/ gives me an easily searchable history when using a completing framework like ivy or helm:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun ar/git-commit-search-message-history ()
    "Search and insert commit message from history."
    (interactive)
    (insert (completing-read "History: "
                             ;; Remove unnecessary newlines from beginning and end.
                             (mapcar (lambda (text)
                                       (string-trim text))
                                     (ring-elements log-edit-comment-ring)))))
#+END_SRC

Now we bind it to /M-r/ and we're good to go:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (bind-key "M-r" #'ar/git-commit-search-message-history git-commit-mode-map)
#+END_SRC

May also want to persist /log-edit-comment-ring/ across Emacs sessions by adding /log-edit-comment-ring/ to savehist variables. Also ensure /savehist-mode/ is enabled:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'savehist-additional-variables log-edit-comment-ring)
  (savehist-mode +1)

[[http://isync.sourceforge.net/][Mbsync]] and [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]] are great for syncing and handling IMAP email. I've now migrated 4 email addresses, including an old Yahoo account.

I wanted to mark all my Yahoo unread emails as read. Yahoo's webmail enables marking 500 emails at a time, making the process a little tedious.

[[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mu-discuss][Mu-discuss]] has a handy [[https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mu-discuss/zaA394sH1Ow/QSVPXS22BQAJ][thread]], highlighting that moving/renaming synced messages (in your local file system) would do the job. This worked well for me.

Let's do just that...

*WARNING:* Copy a small sample of your mails to a separate directory and run some trials until you feel comfortable.

Find your mail directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cd path/to/mail
#+END_SRC

Peek at the messages you'd like to mark unread:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ls -1 new/
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
  1529958027.57518_11.mbp,U=8415:2,

  1532464801.21057_2.mbp,U=9029:2,

Rename message files by appending "S" to their filename and moving from new/ to cur/ directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  for FILE in new/*; do mv "${FILE}" cur/$(basename "${FILE}")S; done;
#+END_SRC

We can verify the move.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ls -1 cur/
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
  1529958027.57518_11.mbp,U=8415:2,S

  1532464801.21057_2.mbp,U=9029:2,S

Let's sync the local changes.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mbsync -Va
#+END_SRC

...and we're done ;)

Retook running recently. Took the dust off my aria scale and used the opportunity to check out fitbit's API.

First register your app at [[https://dev.fitbit.com/apps/new][dev.fitbit.com/apps/new]] and get a client_id=AABBCC.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/fitbit-api-org-babel-and-gnuplot/fitbitapp.png]]

You'll also need your USER_ID, from your Fitbitx user profile.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/fitbit-api-org-babel-and-gnuplot/fitbituser.png]]

We'll also need a token. I used the [[https://dev.fitbit.com/build/reference/web-api/oauth2/][implicit grant flow]] URL in my browser and extracted access_token=TOKEN.

Now let's wire up two org source blocks to fetch the data and subsequently plot using gnuplot.

It's pretty neat. You can take the output from one source block and use it as input to another.

We use curl to fetch data from fitbit's API and pipe through [[https://stedolan.github.io/jq/][jq]] and sed to massage the output format into two columns.

*Note:* Before using gnuplot in org babel, you'll need to install the gnuplot package and add to babel languages.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package gnuplot :ensure t)

  (use-package ob
    :config
    (org-babel-do-load-languages
     'org-babel-load-languages

Narrowing utilities are a wonderful way of increasing productivity. I have a few workflows using Emacs's [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]] framework.

There are great productivity boosters like [[https://www.alfredapp.com/][Alfred]] and [[https://qsapp.com/][Quicksilver]] for macOS, with batteries included.

If you're a tinkerer, you'd enjoy the powerful [[http://hammerspoon.org/][Hammerspoon]]. Like elisp gluing all things Emacs, Hammerspoon uses Lua to glue all things macOS. You can build your own narrowing utilities using [[http://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/hs.chooser.html][chooser]] and a little Lua.

  local chooser = hs.chooser.new(function(choice)
        hs.alert.show(choice['text'])
  end)

  chooser:choices({
        {
           ["text"] = "Alfred\n",
           ["subText"] = "macOS only\n",
        },
        {
           ["text"] = "Quicksilver\n",
           ["subText"] = "macOS only\n",
        },
        {
           ["text"] = "Hammerspoon\n",
           ["subText"] = "macOS only\n",
        },
        {
           ["text"] = "Emacs\n",
           ["subText"] = "is everywhere :)\n",
        },

Howard Abrams's post on [[http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/capturing-content.html][Capturing Content for Emacs]] inspired me to look at gluing Emacs and macOS to launch my own cross-platform narrowing utilities.

I've also taken this opportunity to look at Oleh Krehel's wonderful completion package: [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Ivy]]. We can use it to build a macOS narrowing utility.

Ivy is remarkably easy to use. Turns out, [[http://oremacs.com/swiper/#api][ivy-read]] is all you need. A simple Emacs completion can be accomplished with little elisp.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (ivy-read "Hello ivy: "
            '("One "
              "Two "
              "Three "
              "Four "))
#+END_SRC

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/emacs-utilities-for-your-os/simple_ivy.png]]

Pretty nifty. Let's make this completion more accessible from the rest of the OS. To do so, we create a separate Emacs frame and make it pretty. We also want it to interact with the OS. We'll use /ivy-read/'s /:action/ to invoke a tiny bit of AppleScript.

Oh and we'll also use some funny quotes to tease ourselves about our beloved editor.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

So where's all this going? I wrote a utility to extract all links from [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenodium/xenodium.github.io/master/index.org][this page's org file]] and make them easily searchable from anywhere on macOS by invoking *⌥-W*.

The keys are bound using Lua, Hammerspoon, and emacsclient. This works well on macOS, but there are alternatives for other operating systems.

#+BEGIN_SRC
  hs.execute("emacsclient -ne \""..elisp.."\" -s /tmp/emacs*/server")
#+END_SRC

Here's the resulting utility in action:

These integrations look promising. They enable me to bring cross-platform Emacs utilities into areas I hadn't considered.

The email fun in Emacs continues. After a few weeks since I [[#trying-out-mu4e-and-offlineimap][started using mu4e and offlineimap]], I'm sold. Both are awesome. [[http://isync.sourceforge.net/mbsync.html][Mbsync]] is an [[http://www.offlineimap.org/][offlineimap]] alternative. Despite resyncing all my mail, the transition was fairly smooth. Here's how...

** Install isync (for mbsync)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       4F08CA48-C23F-4B81-AA50-A5BC0A249687
:END:

:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       B36A61B9-0E3A-4CBF-9A4F-286414CE8256
:END:

Mbsync uses ~~/.mbsyncrc~ for configuration. Migrating [[#trying-out-mu4e-and-offlineimap][~/.offlineimaprc]] to ~~/.mbsyncrc~ looks like:

#+BEGIN_SRC conf

My IMAP provider doesn't handle concurrent IMAP commands. [[https://kdecherf.com/blog/2017/05/01/mbsync-and-office-365/][mbsync and Office 365]] had the answer:

** Initial sync
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       79996332-9C51-4403-9AF8-AA76474FE2EE
:END:

Run initial from the command line sync:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mbsync -Va
#+END_SRC

While syncing my largest inbox, it sometimes received an unexpected EOF error:

#+BEGIN_SRC
  IMAP error: unexpected EOF from some.imap.host.com (1.2.3.4:993)
#+END_SRC

First few times, I restarted the syncing manually, but then used a loop to automatically restart it.

Bash loops:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  while true; do mbsync -V Personal; sleep 5; done
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  for i in {1..5}; do mbsync -V Personal; sleep 5 done
#+END_SRC

Eshell loop:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  for i in (number-sequence 1 10) {mbsync -V Personal; sleep 5}
#+END_SRC

** Create mu index
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5B1EF6C3-C551-4909-82BE-6527C1260556
:END:

Reindex using mu, but first remove existing index for offlineimap messages:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  rm -rf ~/.mu
#+END_SRC

Ok, do index now:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mu index --maildir=~/IMAP
#+END_SRC

** Mu4e tweaks
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6C8EC07D-070B-4ED8-AE5B-32CEAD989343
:END:

The /get mail/ command should now point to mbsync.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (csetq mu4e-get-mail-command "mbsync -Va")
#+END_SRC

I had issues with duplicate IDs after moving and deleting messages from mu4e. [[http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/migrating-from-offlineimap-to-mbsync-for-mu4e/][Migrating from offlineimap to mbsync for mu4e]] had the answer:

Managing Email from Emacs. Surely that's crazy-talk, but hey... let's give it a try.

** Install offlineimap
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       483FD90E-BEB9-4727-8191-E5EBE87D70D4
:END:
Need to sync via imap. Use offlineimap. I'm on macOS, so homebrew is king for installing:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install offlineimap
#+END_SRC

Before can configure offlineimap, we'll need to handle a few things first.

** Get a cert fingerprint
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       759FAC2F-C2B5-473E-B7DA-6ACC46DD06A0
:END:

Use openssl for getting a certificate fingerprint. From offlineimap's [[http://www.offlineimap.org/doc/FAQ.html#view-the-fingerprint][FAQ:]]

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  SSL_CERT_DIR="" openssl s_client -connect imap.migadu.com:993 < /dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -fingerprint -noout -text -in /dev/stdin
#+END_SRC

Should give you something like:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  SHA1 Fingerprint=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:DD:FF:AA:00:AA:2A:AA:AA:AA:A8:20:80:AA:A2:AA
#+END_QUOTE

** Encrypt password
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       F1D0EB12-3D5B-494C-993F-FC8461D48908
:END:
Offlineimap can read passwords in plain text in its .offlineimaprc config file, but that's yuckie. Let's encrypt the password and use gnupg for that. Install it:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install gnupg
#+END_SRC

If you haven't already, generate a key

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  gpg --full-gen-key
#+END_SRC

Generate an offlineimap account password file.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  echo "YourPassword" | gpg --encrypt --recipient "Your Name" -o ~/.offlineimap_accountname.gpg
#+END_SRC

** Python password  wrapper
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       75BB6B6D-0FE3-46FD-AC23-B36CB902F305
:END:

Based on Fabian's [[https://f-koehler.github.io/posts/2015-03-17-offlineimap-msmtp-gnupg.html][Encrypt OfflineIMAP and msmtp password with GnuPG]], I created ~/.read_password.py with:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  import os
  import subprocess

  def read_password(path):
    return subprocess.check_output(["gpg\n", "--quiet\n", "--batch\n", "-d\n", os.path.expanduser(path)]).strip()
#+END_SRC

ps. Alternatively, see [[http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/the-homely-mutt/#retrieving-passwords][The homely Mutt]]'s section to store password in macOS's keychain.

** Configure offlineimap
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       63F55360-D822-4A90-A741-B54EB0F83EAF
:END:

Offlineimap uses ~/.offlineimaprc for configuration. We now have all we need to put the configuration together:

#+BEGIN_SRC conf
[general]
accounts = Personal

# Load this python file.
pythonfile = ~/.read_password.py

[Account Personal]
localrepository = Personal-Local

remoterepository = Personal-Remote

# After syncing, let mu index it.
postsynchook = mu index --maildir ~/stuff/active/Mail

# Sync imap every 5 minutes.
autorefresh = 5

# Alternate between 10 quick syncs and full syncs.
quick = 10

[Repository Personal-Local]
type = Maildir
localfolders = ~/stuff/active/Mail/Personal

[Repository Personal-Remote]
type = IMAP
remotehost = some.imap.host.com
remoteuser = your_user_name

Wanted to try out some code, but needed to ensure never checked in. Git pre-commit hooks are handy in this space. Add the following script to search for either @COMMITFAIL or @NOCOMMIT in the staged files. If found, attempts to commit will fail.

Based on https://gist.github.com/rex/223b4be50285f6b8b3e06dea50d15887:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  #!/bin/bash

  set -o nounset
  set -o errexit

  echo "Arguments:"
  echo "$@"
  echo "---"

  readonly FILES_PATTERN='(\..+)?$'
  readonly FORBIDDEN='(@?NOCOMMIT|@?COMMITFAIL)'

  if ( git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E "$FILES_PATTERN" | xargs grep -E --with-filename -n "$FORBIDDEN" ); then
    echo "ERROR: @COMMITFAIL or @NOCOMMIT found. Exiting to save you from yourself."
    exit 1
  fi
#+END_SRC

Save to a file and create a symbolic link to your .git/hooks directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ln -s ../../git/commit-fail-pre-hook.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit

[[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][Projectile]] and [[https://company-mode.github.io][company]] are just amazing Emacs packages. Projectile gives random access to files, while company completes well... anything. For shells, Emacs has a handful of options.

Standing on the shoulders of package giants ([[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][dash]] and [[https://github.com/rejeep/f.el][f]] included) and some elisp, we can bring random access to project directories from the shell.

Had problems installing and using GnuPG on macOS, primarily for Emacs use:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
gpg: problem with the agent: Inappropriate ioctl for device
gpg: error creating passphrase: Operation cancelled
gpg: symmetric encryption of '[stdin]' failed: Operation cancelled
#+END_EXAMPLE

Basic installation required:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install gnupg
#+END_SRC

But worked around the error above by using pinentry-mac (UI), instead of Emacs prompts.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install pinentry-mac
#+END_SRC

Edited ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pinentry-program path/to/homebrew/bin/pinentry-mac
#+END_EXAMPLE

May need to kill gpg-agent to reload config.

Getting the Qt prefix can be done by inspecting QtCore's strings:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
  strings /Users/myuser/homebrew/Cellar/qt/5.12.3/Frameworks/QtCore.framework/QtCore | grep qt_prfxpath
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

Ok so qt_prfxpath is pointing to //usr/local/Cellar/qt/, while my installation's is at //Users/myuser/homebrew/Cellar/qt/. This is problematic and indeed my fault for installing homebrew in //Users/myuser/homebrew/ instead of the recommended //usr/local/.

Symlinking did the job:

#+begin_src sh
  sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/Cellar
  sudo ln -s ~/homebrew/Cellar/qt /usr/local/Cellar/qt
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh

I wrote about [[#search-bash-history-with-emacs-helm][searching bash history with Emacs Helm]] some time ago. Since then, I've learned about /completing-read/ to generically handle simple Emacs completions (very handy for supporting Helm, Ivy, and Ido completions).

Here's a simple way to combine /completing-read/ and the /compile/ command to enable fuzzy searching your compile history:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/fuzzy-search-emacs-compile-history/fuzzy_compile.gif]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun ar/compile-completing ()
    "Compile with completing options."
    (interactive)
    (let ((compile-command (completing-read "Compile command: " compile-history)))
      (compile compile-command)
      (add-to-list 'compile-history compile-command)))
#+END_SRC

:END:
Can't miss out on all the new fun. Emacs 25 RC2 is out and lots of people already using it. Since I'm mostly on MacOS these days, installing via homebrew with --devel, gets you RC2:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install emacs --devel --with-cocoa --with-gnutls --with-librsvg --with-imagemagick
#+END_SRC

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/jumping-on-emacs-25-bandwagon/emacs25.png]]

The only hiccup so far's been org mode failing to export, which was fixed by re-installing it (follow [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2015-08/msg00320.html][this thread]]).

:END:
Having read [[http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/05/opinion/sunday/are-you-in-despair-thats-good.html][Are You in Despair? That’s Good]], I was encouraged to expand my emotional vocabulary. As a [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/play/zone.el][zone.el]] fan (checkout [[https://github.com/wasamasa/zone-nyan][nyan]], [[https://github.com/kawabata/zone-sl][sl]], and [[https://github.com/kawabata/zone-rainbow][rainbow]]), I looked into writing a zone [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/play/zone.el#L52][program]]. When /zone-when-idle/ is set, zone acts as a screensaver of sorts. We can use this to display random emotional vocab whenever Emacs is idle for a period of time. Let's get to it...

Zone keeps a list of programs to choose from when kicked off. Below is a basic /zone-hello/ program, along with an interactive command for previewing. Not much to these. The tiny program prepares the screen for zoning and inserts text while no input is pending.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun zone-hello ()
    (delete-other-windows)
    (setq mode-line-format nil)
    (zone-fill-out-screen (window-width) (window-height))
    (delete-region (point-min) (point-max))
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (while (not (input-pending-p))
      (insert "hello zone\n")
      (zone-park/sit-for (point-min) 0.2)))

  (defun zone-hello-preview ()
    (interactive)
    (let ((zone-programs [zone-hello]))
      (zone)))
#+END_SRC

Here's what /zone-hello/ looks like:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/emacs-and-emotional-vocab/minimal-zone.gif]]

Back to improving our emotional vocabulary, we'll need a dictionary for our goal. A quick search yields a potential list of [[http://www.psychpage.com/learning/library/assess/feelings.html][words]]. We can use [[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/][WordNet]] to define them while offline. These two sources will do for now. We tie it all together in [[https://github.com/xenodium/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/ar/zone-words.el][zone-words.el]] and the resulting zone program looks as follow:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/emacs-and-emotional-vocab/emotions.gif]]

UPDATE: Just came across [[http://blog.josephwilk.net/art/emacs-animation.html][Animations With Emacs]]. A post with awesome zone examples.

Needed to find the number of days between two dates. Emacs calendar must know this...

- Fire up the manual (M-x info-emacs-manual or C-h r).
- Info-goto-node (or g).
- Type "counting days" and voilá:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
To determine the number of days in a range, set the mark on one date
using `C-<SPC>', move point to another date, and type `M-='
(`calendar-count-days-region').  The numbers of days shown is
_inclusive_; that is, it includes the days specified by mark and point.
#+END_QUOTE

As some point I had to generate a random MAC address. This is the snippet I used:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :exports both
  import random

  def randomMAC():
    mac = [0x00, 0x16, 0x3e,
           random.randint(0x00, 0x7f),
           random.randint(0x00, 0xff),
           random.randint(0x00, 0xff),
    ]
    return ':'.join(map(lambda x: "%02x" % x, mac))

  print 'MAC => %s' % randomMAC()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: MAC => 00:16:3e:7e:f7:fa

You can use "M-x /apropos-variable/" to get documentation for variables matching a pattern. For more flexibility, some elisp can help with getting a list of all variables matching a regexp:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :exports both
  (defun ar/variables-matching-pattern (pattern)
    "Get a list of all variables matching PATTERN."
    (let ((matched-variables '()))
      (mapatoms
       (lambda (symbol)
         ;; Symbol is variable?
         (when (and (boundp symbol)
                    (string-match pattern (symbol-name symbol)))
           (add-to-list 'matched-variables symbol))))
      matched-variables))

  (let ((variables ""))
    (mapc (lambda (variable-symbol)
            (setq variables
                  (concat variables
                          (format "%s => %s\n"
                                  (symbol-name variable-symbol)

My girlfriend recently made a delicious chocolate fondant. Saving the [[http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/feb/10/how-cook-perfect-chocolate-fondants][The Guardian's recipe]]:
** Ingredients (2 servings)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       42DD9247-0C7C-4503-BC4C-422E943977C4
:END:
- 60g unsalted butter, cut into dice, plus extra to grease
- 1 tbsp cocoa powder
- 60g dark chocolate, broken into pieces
- 1 egg and 1 egg yolk
- 60g caster sugar
- 1 tbsp plain flour
** Preparation
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       48A1687D-7249-43ED-B3D3-02E314036370
:END:
1. Pre-heat the oven to 200C if cooking immediately, and put a baking tray on the middle shelf. Butter the inside of 2 small ramekins or pudding moulds, and then put the cocoa in one and turn it to coat the inside, holding it over the second mould to catch any that escapes. Do the same with the other mould.
2. Put the butter and chocolate into a heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a pan of simmering water and stir occasionally until melted. Allow to cool slightly.
3. Vigorously whisk together the egg, yolk, sugar and a pinch of salt until pale and fluffy. Gently fold in the melted chocolate and butter, and then the flour. Spoon into the prepared moulds, stopping just shy of the top – at this point the mixture can be refrigerated until needed, or even frozen, as the puddings will not wait around once cooked.
4. Put on to a hot baking tray and cook for 12 minutes (14 if from cold, 16 if frozen) until the tops are set and coming away from the sides of the moulds. Leave to rest for 30 seconds and then serve in the ramekins or turn out on to plates if you're feeling confident – they're great with clotted cream or plain ice cream.

Got a CD with my chest X-ray from the hospital. Was expecting a pdf or an image of sorts, but the CD content was rather different. For starters, it was targeted at Windows users (AUTORUN.INF, MediaViewerLauncher.EXE and a bunch of DLLs):

#+BEGIN_SRC text

#+END_SRC

I'm on a Mac, so most of these files were not useful to me. The more interesting files were IM_0001 and ED_0001 with "application/dicom" MIME type. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM][DICOM]] files stand for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine. How to view these on a Mac? [[http://www.osirix-viewer.com/Downloads.html][OsiriX viewer]] is an option. OsiriX, though on the heavy side (100.7MB download), it rendered the X-ray successfully.

[[file:images/view-dicom-files-from-your-x-ray/2015-12-03-osirix-x-ray-small.png]]

Unsurprisingly, ImageMagick's [[http://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php][convert]] utility also handles DICOM files. Converting to PNG worked well.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ convert ./DICOM/PAT_0000/STD_0000/SER_0001/OBJ_0001/ED_0001 ED_0001.png
#+END_SRC

[[file:images/view-dicom-files-from-your-x-ray/2015-12-03-imagemagick-x-ray-small.png]]


DICOM files also hold patient's metadata and optional reports. The file format is [[http://cabiatl.com/mricro/dicom/index.html][well known]]. OsiriX gives you access to it, but a few lines of python can also extract it for you. First install the [[https://github.com/darcymason/pydicom][pydicom]] package:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ sudo pip install pydicom
#+END_SRC

Running the python interpreter is enough to peak at the metadata:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  >>> import dicom
  >>> ds = dicom.read_file("./DICOM/PAT_0000/STD_0000/SER_0000/OBJ_0001/IM_0001")

There were other DICOM files with a report:

#+END_SRC

[[http://dcmtk.org/dcmtk.php.en][DCMTK]] is another alternative tool to extract DICOM metadata. The source is available and can be built:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ tar xf dcmtk-3.6.0.tar.gz
  $ cd dcmtk-3.6.0
  $ cmake .
  $ make
#+END_SRC

Or installed via homebrew:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ brew install dcmtk
#+END_SRC

DCMTK includes dcmdump. You can use it to dump DICOM files:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh

There's a corner in Chinatown hosting some truly superb treats. If you get caught in the rush between Newport court and Newport place, you'd likely fail to notice some the awesome street food stands.

I've walked past this place many times and never noticed it. They serve a handful of items, but the grilled chilly squid skewers caught my attention. They're grilled, brushed with chilly sauce and finished with sprinkled sesame and cumin seeds. Super tasty.

:END:
I first had these delicious breakfast savory pancakes at a Beijing street food stall. Never expected to randomly find Jiān Bǐng in London. It's a crepe with an additional egg spread, hoisin sauce, chilly sauce, hot chillies, topped with spring onions and coriander, all wrapping a wonderfully crispy bread cracker. And.. it's awesome.

** Tai Yaki

:END:
Chinatown Bakery is hard to miss. Pedestrian traffic slows down as we all fall under the spell of the Tai Yaki machine. This wonderful assembly line produces fish-shaped sweet waffles filled with custard. They are the perfect dessert after some savory street snacks. You can get a bag of 4 for £2.

[[http://www.lucky7london.co.uk][Lucky 7]] is a small nostalgic American diner on Westbourne Park road. I like the vibe, the space, and the unpretentious waiting staff. I go to Lucky 7 often enough, originally for the buttermilk pancakes, but the list of favorites on the menu keeps growing.

These are my favorite pancakes in London by far. Banana buttermilk pancakes and a few free coffee refills usually sort me out until dinner time. Add a side of bacon if extra hungry. You probably don't need it though.

I've loved my [[http://www.amazon.com/Soundmagic-PL30-In-Ear-Headphones/dp/B001MQ3CCO][Soundmagic PL30 in-ear headphones]]. They're relatively inexpensive, comfortable, and great for exercising (they stay in). Audio quality and bass have been good enough (I don't need much). Unfortunately, I've had two pairs of PL30's and both stopped working after a year or two. I'm replacing the last pair with [[http://www.amazon.co.uk/RHA-MA750-Isolating-In-Ear-Headphone-Black/dp/B00ELAM8LE][RHA's MA750]] (an upgrade, me hopes).

Other contenders considered: [[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Etymotic-Research-Portable-iPhone-Earphones-Black/dp/B000XPG2QI][Etymotic Research HF5]], and [[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Shure-SE215-In-Ear-Isolating-Earphones-Clear/dp/B004U9NH3E][Shure SE215]]. Also considered bluetooth alternatives like [[http://www.amazon.com/JayBird-BlueBuds-Sport-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B00AIRUOI8?][JayBird BlueBuds X]] and [[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Plantronics-BackBeat-Wireless-Earbuds-Frustration-Black/dp/B00DZTHW9U][Plantronics BackBeat GO 2]].

I'm somewhat nervous to pay more for a pair of headphones. Let's hope they don't meet the same unfortunate fate. We'll see.

There are three browser tabs continously used in my workflow: GMail, Google Calendar, and Google Play Music. I normally have many more tabs open, but these three I access periodically. As the number of open tabs increases, and I fail to cleanup, getting back to my usual three gets a little trickier.

So far, I've kept each of these services open in separate windows. But that doesn't always work. Click on any link in your inbox and you're back to playing cleanup. This is where [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site-specific_browser][site-specific browsers]] (SSB) can help.

[[https://github.com/dmarmor/epichrome][Epichrome]] enables you to build Chrome-based SSBs (on Mac OSX). Build an SSB for the usual suspects and easily jump to them using the app switcher.

UPDATE: Enable the Chrome extension to open URLs in default browser.

Converting mp4 to gif is handy for posting short screencasts. You can convert to gif using ffmpeg and optimize with imagemagick. To install:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  apt-get install ffmpeg imagemagick (linux)
  brew install ffmpeg imagemagick (Mac)
#+END_SRC
Convert to gif:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ffmpeg -i my.mp4 -pix_fmt rgb24 -r 5 my.gif
#+END_SRC
Optimize with:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  convert -dither none -layers Optimize my.gif my_optimized.gif
#+END_SRC

UPDATE: There's also licecap and subsequently optimize with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cat source.gif | gifsicle --colors 256 --optimize=3 --delay=15 > target.gif
#+END_SRC

UPDATE: [[https://gist.github.com/dergachev/4627207][Also consider for .mov]]:

OK not quite, but having recently learned about [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Appending-Kills.html][C-M-w (append-next-kill)]], I used it in a keyboard macro to fish out matching lines. This is similar to [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Other-Repeating-Search.html][flush-lines]], except the kill ring is also populated. This is handy, if you need the flushed lines. Here's an example.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/fishing-with-emacs/fishing.gif]]

Here's the equivalent in Emacs lisp:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun flush-kill-lines (regex)
    "Flush lines matching REGEX and append to kill ring.  Restrict to \
  region if active."
    (interactive "sFlush kill regex: ")
    (save-excursion
      (save-restriction
        (when (use-region-p)
          (narrow-to-region (point) (mark))
          (goto-char 0))
        (while (search-forward-regexp regex nil t)

If you haven't bought [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/book][Mastering Emacs]] by [[https://twitter.com/mickeynp][Mickey Petersen]], you should. It's a wonderful source of Emacs tips. Having just finished the ebook on my Kindle, I was keen to go back and fish out some of that newly found wisdom. My immediate reaction was to figure out a way to make the ebook searchable from Emacs.

The ebook is available in epub and pdf format. Though Emacs's docview is super handy for viewing pdf's, searching didn't feel as comfortable as searching in org mode. The epub, on the other hand, proved useful. [[http://pandoc.org][Pandoc]] can easily convert from epub to org.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pandoc  --from=epub --to=org mastering-emacs.epub > mastering-emacs.org
#+END_SRC

After a some tidying (mostly removing BEGIN_HTML/END_HTML blocks and adding TITLE/AUTHOR), the resulting org file is surprisingly clean and easy to search/navigate. [[https://github.com/ShingoFukuyama/helm-swoop][helm-swoop]] and [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/blob/199b9feb396eedc0e502dd767b19060f7dc09f6a/helm-org.el][helm-org-in-buffer-headings]] are great for that.

Played with [[http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/PlantUML_Language_Reference_Guide.pdf][Plantuml]]. Convenient for generating UML diagrams from text. Here's the [[http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/PlantUML_Language_Reference_Guide.pdf][Language Reference Guide]]. Here's an example:
#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :exports both :file images/plantuml-example/plantuml-singer.png
  @startuml
    abstract class Singer {
      abstract void sing()
      void Dance()
    }

    skinparam monochrome true
    Singer <|-- PopSinger
    Singer <|-- SalsaSinger

    class PopSinger {
      void sing()
    }

    class SalsaSinger {
      void sing()
    }

  @enduml
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:images/plantuml-example/plantuml-singer.png]]

Install plantuml on Mac OS X:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install plantum
#+END_SRC

Generating diagram:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $GRAPHVIZ_DOT=~/homebrew/bin/dot java -jar path/to/plantuml.8018.jar diagram.plantuml
#+END_SRC

Want to re-evaluate defvars and modify variables? eval-defun (bound to C-M-x) can help. From the manual:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If the current defun is actually a call to `defvar', then reset the
variable using its initial value expression even if the variable
already has some other value.  (Normally `defvar' does not change the
variable's value if it already has a value.)  Treat `defcustom'
similarly.

- Prefer double quotes if escaping single quotes.
- Prefer string interpolation over join. Eg. "'%s'" % member_default.
- Prefer double underscore for privates.
- Prefer with statement to implicitly close file.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  with open(path, 'r') as text_file:
      text = text_file.read()
#+END_SRC
- Prefer list comprehensions to filter.
- Prefer using separate modules over classes if only using for separation.
- Keep in mind: "eafp vs lbyl" (ie. just let it throw).
- Prefer exceptions over assertions.
- Throw ValueError for wrong input.
- Return explicit False if remaining case is always false.
