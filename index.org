/✨[[https://github.com/sponsors/xenodium][sponsor]]✨ this content/

I've been toying with the idea of managing browser bookmarks from [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][you know where]]. Maybe dump a bunch of links into an org file and use that as a quick and dirty bookmark manager. We'll start with a flat list plus fuzzy searching and see how far that gets us.

The org file would look a little something like this:

#+CAPTION: bookmarks.org
#+begin_src org
  My bookmarks
  - [[https://lobste.rs/t/emacs][Emacs editor (Lobsters)]]
  - [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com][Emacs Stack Exchange]]
  - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs][Emacs subreddit]]
  - [[https://emacs.ch][Emacs.ch (Mastodon)]]
  - [[https://www.emacswiki.org][EmacsWiki]]
  - [[https://planet.emacslife.com/][Planet Emacslife]]
#+end_src

Next we need fuzzy searching, but first let's write a little elisp to extract all links from the org file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (require 'org-element)
  (require 'seq)

  (defun browser-bookmarks (org-file)
    "Return all links from ORG-FILE."
    (with-temp-buffer
      (let (links)
        (insert-file-contents org-file)
        (org-mode)
        (org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer) 'link
          (lambda (link)
            (let* ((raw-link (org-element-property :raw-link link))
                   (content (org-element-contents link))
                   (title (substring-no-properties (or (seq-first content) raw-link))))
              (push (concat title
                            "\n"
                            (propertize raw-link 'face 'whitespace-space)
                            "\n")
                    links)))
          nil nil 'link)
        (seq-sort 'string-greaterp links))))
#+end_src

The snippet uses =org-element= to iterate over links to collect/return them in a list. We join both the title and url, so searching can match either of these values. We also add a little formatting (new lines/face) to spiff things up.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results value code
  (browser-bookmarks "/private/tmp/bookmarks.org")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

   (face whitespace-space)))
#+end_src

We can now feed our list to our preferred narrowing framework (ivy, helm, ido, vertico) and use it to quickly select a bookmark. In the past, I've [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-utilities-for-your-os/][used the likes of ivy-read]] directly, though have since adopted the humble but mighty =completing-read= which hooks up to any of the above frameworks.

With that in mind, let's use =completing-read= to make a selection and split the text to extract the corresponding URL. Feed it to =browse-url=, and you got your preferred browser opening your bookmark.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun open-bookmark ()
    (interactive)
    (browse-url (seq-elt (split-string (completing-read "Open: " (browser-bookmarks "/private/tmp/bookmarks.org")) "\n") 1)))
#+end_src

I remain a happy ivy user, so we can see its fuzzy searching in action.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
[[file:images/building-your-own-bookmark-launcher/emacs-bookmark.gif]]

At this point, we now have our bookmark-launching Emacs utility. It's only an =M-x open-bookmark= command away, but we want to make it accessible from anywhere in our operating system, in my case macOS.

Let's enable launching from the command line, though before we do that, let's craft a dedicated frame for this purpose.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defmacro present (&rest body)
    "Create a buffer with BUFFER-NAME and eval BODY in a basic frame."
    (declare (indent 1) (debug t))
    `(let* ((buffer (get-buffer-create (generate-new-buffer-name "*present*")))
            (frame (make-frame '((auto-raise . t)
                                 (font . "Menlo 15")
                                 (top . 200)
                                 (height . 20)
                                 (width . 110)
                                 (internal-border-width . 20)
                                 (left . 0.33)
                                 (left-fringe . 0)
                                 (line-spacing . 3)
                                 (menu-bar-lines . 0)
                                 (minibuffer . only)
                                 (right-fringe . 0)
                                 (tool-bar-lines . 0)
                                 (undecorated . t)
                                 (unsplittable . t)
                                 (vertical-scroll-bars . nil)))))
       (set-face-attribute 'ivy-current-match frame
                           :background "#2a2a2a"
                           :foreground 'unspecified)
       (select-frame frame)
       (select-frame-set-input-focus frame)
       (with-current-buffer buffer
         (condition-case nil
             (unwind-protect
                 ,@body
               (delete-frame frame)
               (kill-buffer buffer))
           (quit (delete-frame frame)
                 (kill-buffer buffer))))))
#+end_src

Most of the snippet styles our new frame and invokes the body parameter. While I don't typically resort to macros, we get a little syntatic sugar here, so we can invoke like so:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun present-open-bookmark-frame ()
    (present (browse-url (seq-elt (split-string (completing-read "Open: " (browser-bookmarks "/private/tmp/bookmarks.org")) "\n") 1))))
#+end_src

Wrapping our one-liner with the =present-open-bookmark-frame= function enables us to easily invoke from the command line, with something like

#+begin_src sh
  emacsclient -ne "(present-open-bookmark-frame)"
#+end_src

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
[[file:images/building-your-own-bookmark-launcher/command.gif]]

Now that we can easily invoke from the command line, we have the flexibility to summon from anywhere. We can even bind to a key shortcut, available anywhere (not just Emacs). I typically do this via [[http://www.hammerspoon.org/][Hammerspoon]], with some helpers, though there are likely simpler options out there.

#+begin_src lua
  function emacsExecute(activate, elisp)
     if activate then
        activateFirstOf({
              {
                 bundleID="org.gnu.Emacs",
                 name="Emacs"
              }
        })
     end

     local socket, found = emacsSocketPath()
     if not found then
        hs.alert.show("Could not get emacs socket path")
        return "", false
     end

     local output,success = hs.execute("/opt/homebrew/bin/emacsclient -ne \""..elisp.."\" -s "..socket)
     if not success then
        hs.alert.show("Emacs did not execute: "..elisp)
        return "", false
     end

     return output, success
  end

  function openBookmark()
     appRequestingEmacs = hs.application.frontmostApplication()
     emacsExecute(false, "(present-open-bookmark-frame)")
     activateFirstOf({
           {
              bundleID="org.gnu.Emacs",
              name="Emacs"
           }
     })
  end

  hs.hotkey.bind({"alt"}, "W", openBookmark)
#+end_src

With that, we have our Emacs-powered bookmark launcher, available from anywhere.

* [2023-11-25 Sat] Native Emacs/macOS UX integrations via Swift modules
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: native-emacsmacos-ux-integrations-via-swift-modules
:END:
Once you learn a little [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp][elisp]], [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] becomes this hyper malleable editor/platform. A live playground of sorts, where almost everything is up for grabs at runtime. Throw some elisp at it, and you can customize or extend almost anything to your heart's content. I say almost, as there's a comparatively small native core, that would typically require recompiling if you wanted to make further (native) mods. But that isn't entirely true. [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/whats-new-in-emacs-25-1][Emacs 25]] enabled us to further extend things by loading native [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Dynamic-Modules.html][dynamic modules]], back in 2016.

Most of my Emacs-bending adventures have been powered by elisp, primarily on macOS. I also happen to have an iOS dev background, so when [[https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy][Valeriy Savchenko]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wemj1z/writing_emacs_dynamic_modules_in_swift/][announced]] his project bringing [[https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy/emacs-swift-module][Emacs dynamic modules powered by Swift]], I added it to my never-ending list of things to try out.

Fast-forward to a year later, and [[https://github.com/roife][Roife]]'s [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/17vrmrk/emt_emacs_macos_tokenizer_for_enhanced_cjk_word/][introduction]] to [[https://github.com/roife/emt][emt]] finally gave me that much-needed nudge to give [[https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy/emacs-swift-module][emacs-swift-module]] a try. While I wish I had done it earlier, I also wish [[https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy/emacs-swift-module][emacs-swift-module]] had gotten more visibility. Native extensions written in Swift can open up some some neat integrations using native macOS UX/APIs.

While I'm new to Savchenko's [[https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy/emacs-swift-module][emacs-swift-module]], the project has [[https://savchenkovaleriy.github.io/emacs-swift-module/documentation/emacsswiftmodule/][wonderful documentation]]. It quickly got me on my way to build an experimental dynamic module introducing a native context menu for sharing files from my beloved editor.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 90%
[[file:images/native-emacsmacos-ux-integrations-via-swift-modules/emacs-share.webp]]

Most of the elisp/native bridging magic happens with fairly little Swift code:

#+begin_src swift
  try env.defun(
    "macos-module--share",
    with: """
      Share files in ARG1.

      ARG1 must be a vector (not a list) of file paths.
      """
  ) { (env: Environment, files: [String]) in
    let urls = files.map { URL(fileURLWithPath: $0) }

    let picker = NSSharingServicePicker(items: urls)
    guard let view = NSApp.mainWindow?.contentView else {
      return
    }

    let x = try env.funcall("macos--emacs-point-x") as Int
    let y = try env.funcall("macos--emacs-point-y") as Int

    let rect = NSRect(
      x: x + 15, y: Int(view.bounds.height) - y + 15, width: 1, height: 1
    )
    picker.show(relativeTo: rect, of: view, preferredEdge: .maxY)
  }
#+end_src

This produced an elisp =macos-module--share= function I could easily access from elisp like so:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun macos-share ()
    "Share file(s) with other macOS apps.

  If visiting a buffer with associated file, share it.

  While in `dired', any selected files, share those.  If region is
  active, share files in region.  Otherwise share file at point."
    (interactive)
    (macos-module--share (vconcat (macos--files-dwim))))
#+end_src

On a side note, =(macos--files-dwim)= chooses files depending on context. That is, [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-dwim-do-what-i-mean/][do what I mean (DWIM) style]]. If there's a file associated with current buffer, share it. When in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]] (the directory editor, aka file manager), look at region, selected files, or default to file at point.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun macos--files-dwim ()
    "Return buffer file (if available) or marked/region files for a `dired' buffer."
    (if (buffer-file-name)
        (list (buffer-file-name))
      (or
       (macos--dired-paths-in-region)
       (dired-get-marked-files))))

  (defun macos--dired-paths-in-region ()
    "If `dired' buffer, return region files.  nil otherwise."
    (when (and (equal major-mode 'dired-mode)
               (use-region-p))
      (let ((start (region-beginning))
            (end (region-end))
            (paths))
        (save-excursion
          (save-restriction
            (goto-char start)
            (while (< (point) end)
              ;; Skip non-file lines.
              (while (and (< (point) end) (dired-between-files))
                (forward-line 1))
              (when (dired-get-filename nil t)
                (setq paths (append paths (list (dired-get-filename nil t)))))
              (forward-line 1))))
        paths)))
#+end_src

I got one more example of a native macOS integration I added. Being an even simpler one, and in hindsight, I prolly should have introduced it first. In any case, this one reveals [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]] files in macOS's Finder app (including the selection itself).

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
[[file:images/native-emacsmacos-ux-integrations-via-swift-modules/reveal.webp]]

#+begin_src swift
  try env.defun(
    "macos-module--reveal-in-finder",
    with: """
      Reveal (and select) files in ARG1 in macOS Finder.

      ARG1 mus be a vector (not a list) of file paths.
      """
  ) { (env: Environment, files: [String]) in
    NSWorkspace.shared.activateFileViewerSelecting(files.map { URL(fileURLWithPath: $0) })
  }
#+end_src

The corresponding elisp is nearly identical to its =macos-share= sibling:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun macos-reveal-in-finder ()
    "Reveal file(s) in macOS Finder.

  If visiting a buffer with associated file, reveal it.

  While in `dired', any selected files, reveal those.  If region is
  active, reveal files in region.  Otherwise reveal file at point."
    (interactive)
    (macos-module--reveal-in-finder (vconcat (macos--files-dwim))))
#+end_src

My Swift module experiment introduces two native macOS UX integrations, now available via =M-x macos-share= and =M-x macos-reveal-in-finder=. I've pushed all code to it's own [[https://github.com/xenodium/EmacsMacOSModule][repo]].

I hope this post brings visibility to the wonderful [[https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy/emacs-swift-module][emacs-swift-module]] project and sparks new, native, and innovative integrations for those on macOS. Can't wait to see what others can do with it.

Get the new key, probably already in gpg key chain. Try listing it:

* [2023-10-30 Mon] How I smash burgers
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: how-i-smash-burgers
:END:
I'm neither a burger expert nor a connoisseur of any kind, yet I sure have a lot of fun smashing burgers at home. Needless to say, I shamelessly enjoy gobbling them too!

#+CAPTION: my smash burger
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%
[[file:images/how-i-smash-burgers/burger-cut.png]]

I'll share details on how I smash my burgers, but here's a quick ingredient list, if that's all you need.

- Mince beef (20%-30% fat).
- Streaky bacon.
- Brioche burger buns.
- American cheese slices (cheddar individual slices work too).
- Lettuce.
- Tomatoes.
- Onions.
- Pickles.
- Jalapeños.
- Garlic.
- Chipotle powder.
- Mayonnaise.
- Salt.
- Pepper.
- Oil.
- Greaseproof paper.
- Butter.

** The calling

My quest to smash burgers at home didn't start until earlier this year, while watching the [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9764362/][The Menu]]. I just could't stop [[https://indieweb.social/@xenodium/109734285674122246][craving the burger]] from that scene, so I set out to start smashing my own.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 98%
[[file:images/how-i-smash-burgers/the-menu.webp]]

** The gear

Don't rush to buy anything fancy. Your existing gear will likely do the job just fine. I'd say try a few things out and only upgrade when needed. I'll share the gear I use and where I felt I needed tweaking.

** Skillet

While I didn't have a griddle at home, I did have a couple of trusty [[https://www.lodgecastiron.com/][Lodge]] *skillets* ([[https://www.lodgecastiron.com/product/round-cast-iron-classic-skillet?sku=L8SK3][cast iron]] and [[https://www.lodgecastiron.com/product/carbon-steel-skillet?sku=CRS12][carbon steel]]). Both work great for burgers, though I have a slight preference for the carbon steel one, as it's the bigger of the two and gives a little more room for manoeuvring, specially when smashing two burgers at a time.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 250px
[[file:images/how-i-smash-burgers/cast-iron.png]]

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 250px
[[file:images/how-i-smash-burgers/carbon.png]]

Heat the skillet up and add a little oil. If the oil starts smoking, be quick to drop the patties and start smashing.

** Grill Spatula (too big/stiff for skillet)

Somewhat inspired by the film, I got myself a wide spatula so I could firmly press those patties against the skillet, and to flip of course.

While this kind of spatula may work well on a spacious griddle, I felt constrained on a relatively small cast iron. Specially when flipping. I went looking for an alternative.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 250px
[[file:images/how-i-smash-burgers/spatula.png]]

** Spatula + smasher (my winning combo)

Over at the [[https://reddit.com/r/castiron/][r/castiron]] subreddit, I discovered fish spatulas. They are fairly agile on cast irons but also work great for loosening burger patties before flipping.

[[file:images/how-i-smash-burgers/ready.webp]]

While effective for flipping, fish spatulas are obviously no good for smashing. So I got myself a burger smasher. This combo worked well for me.

[[file:images/how-i-smash-burgers/smash.webp]]

When smashing, use greaseproof paper to prevent the patties from sticking to the smasher.

** Ingredients

While I've drawn inspiration from others, I've landed on my own preferred ingredients. I'm sure that will continue changing over time. Pick and choose as your heart desires.

** Minced/ground beef

Minced beef with higher fat content (around 20-30%) is often recommended for a couple of reasons:

- Flavour: Fat equals flavour in cooking. The higher fat content will melt during cooking and become 'self-basting', resulting in a juicier and more flavourful burger.

- Texture: The fat in the beef melts under heat, helping the burger achieve a crispy, caramelized exterior known as the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction][Maillard reaction]], which contrasts nicely against the soft, juicy interior.

In the UK, I can typically find minced beef with 15%-20% fat content at the main supermarkets.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 200px
[[file:images/how-i-smash-burgers/pattie.png]]

Be sure to salt and pepper to taste (as in picture) on one side. Once flipped on pan, salt and pepper the other side.

** Bacon

I tend to prefer smoked streaky bacon, but hey these will be your burgers. Your burgers, your rules.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 250px
[[file:images/how-i-smash-burgers/streaky.png]]

** Buns (brioche)

I hear potato buns are great for burgers. I've yet to try them. So far, I've settled for brioche. I happen to find these near me, so I've gone with them.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 350px
[[file:images/how-i-smash-burgers/brioche.png]]

Butter the buns and brown on the skillet for a minute. Check the buns often. Brioche buns can burn quickly.

** American cheese

American cheese is often the burger cheese of choice.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 98%
[[file:images/how-i-smash-burgers/american-cheese.webp]]

While American cheese isn't widely available in the UK, the individually wrapped orange-looking cheddar cheese slices work just fine.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 250px
[[file:images/how-i-smash-burgers/cheese.png]]

** Toppings

I like my burgers with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, and occasionally jalapeños. For pickles, I typically just take cornichons and slice them up.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 350px
[[file:images/how-i-smash-burgers/toppings_x0.30.png]]

** Burger sauce (chipotle/garlic/mayo)

While classic burger sauce is often made with mayo, ketchup, pickles, and mustard, I've gone fairly rogue here.

You see, I love chipotle mayo. I'm also a fan of garlic mayo, so I figured why not both? Turns out these three ingredients work great together.

I like to draw out the flavours by first mixing the garlic and chipotle with a little hot water.

- 1 garlic clove.
- 2 teaspoons of chipotle powder.
- 1 tablespoon of hot water.
- Pinch of salt.

I like to assemble in the following order from the bottom bun up.

1. Sauce on bottom bun.
2. Lettuce.
3. Tomatoes.
4. Onions.
5. 2 patties (melted cheese on both).
6. Bacon.
7. Pickles.
8. Jalapeños.
9. Sauce on top bun (oops, I forgot in the picture).

* [2023-10-24 Tue] Open in Xcode at line number
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: open-in-xcode-at-line-number
:END:
I live mostly in Emacs. I say mostly 'cause well, I'm fairly pragmatic about it. If there's a workflow elsewhere that's more appropriate for my needs, I'll happily use that instead. While I'd love to do my web browsing from my beloved editor, Firefox ticks the right boxes for me.

I do most of my iOS coding in Emacs. It's a hybrid of sorts between Emacs and Xcode. If I need to use the debugger, Xcode is a clear winner for me. If I happen to be visiting a Swift file in an Emacs buffer, I typically used the handy =crux-open-with= from [[https://github.com/bbatsov/crux][crux]] to open in Xcode, and continue from there. This worked OK, but I always wished opening in Xcode would also jump to the same line number as the Emacs point (cursor) location. This is particularly useful if I had just spotted where I'd like to set a breakpoint in an Emacs buffer and need to transition over to Xcode.

It turns out, there's a nifty command line utility for that. [[https://www.unix.com/man-page/osx/1/xed/][xed]], the Xcode text editor invocation tool. It enables telling Xcode what file to open and at what line number:

#+begin_src sh
  xed -line 141 path/to/some/file.swift
#+end_src

With that in mind, I've added my own version of =crux-open-with=, using [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]].

When running on macOS, the function checks whether or not I'm visiting a buffer for a programming language, and opens the file in Xcode at the same line number.

ps. If you find opening the same file in a different context handy, you may also like the package [[https://github.com/rmuslimov/browse-at-remote][browse-at-remote]] that opens the visited file at its corresponding remote location (for example, GitHub).

* [2023-10-06 Fri] Trimming video screenshots
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: trimming-video-screenshots
:END:
A quick one... I recently wanted to trim the black borders around a video screenshot. While I could use an image editor to manually select and trim, I wondered if there was an [[https://imagemagick.org/][imagemagick]] trick somewhere out there for such a thing... and of course there was:

#+begin_src sh
  magick convert -fuzz 3% -define trim:percent-background=0% -trim +repage path/to/input.png path/to/output.png
#+end_src

Pretty neat. It does the job, but I won't remember it next time. May as well make another [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]] function out of it and conveniently invoke from Emacs via a memorable name plus fuzzy search.

While the screenshot I've just used was a little blurry, it's from the movie [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1104001/][Tron Legacy]], and it features Emacs eshell. This is old news, though [[https://irreal.org/blog/?p=9573][well covered]].

* [2023-10-06 Fri] Displaying image details in mode line
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: displaying-image-details-in-mode-line
:END:
A benefit of running Emacs as a GUI app, is that you can view images from your beloved editor. This is super handy to take a quick peek at any image.

Sometimes, I'd like a little more than just viewing the image. I'd like to see basic image details like type, dimensions, and file size. The [[https://imagemagick.org/][imagemagick]] =identify= utility is pretty handy for that.

#+begin_src bash
  identify -format "%m %wx%h %b" path/to/image.png
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: PNG 2387x1055 2.28454MB

I could easily invoke =shell-command= for this or even create a [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]] function (maybe I will), but if this info was proactively displayed in the mode line, I wouldn't have to fetch it myself.

Since I know I can use the =identify= command for this, I may as well see if I can plug it into the mode line.

Turns out this wasn't too bad by setting =setting mode-line-format=. I added a little logic to only include image details while in =image-mode= and rely on =process-lines= to fetch the details. This function returns a list, which is a happy coincidence since =mode-line-format= also expects a list.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80%

My next thought was to create a new account using the iOS simulator, but that complained about creating too many accounts already. Strange, as I hadn't created any.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%
[[file:images/creating-icloud-test-accounts/iphone.png]]

I could create an account from macOS settings itself, though that would require logging out my current account (and the syncing implications). To get around that, I could maybe create a temporary macOS user. Instead, I somewhat revisited the simulator route and looked for a VM option to run macOS. This gave me an excuse to play with VM options on macOS.

I had been meaning to check out [[https://github.com/lima-vm/lima][lima]] as per Hacker News's [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36668964][Lima: A nice way to run Linux VMs on Mac]]. The Hacker News's [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36668964][thread]] has a handful of great recommendations. Amongst them, [[https://github.com/cirruslabs/tart/][tart]] (macOS and Linux VMs on Apple Silicon) stood out, as it also gave me the Mac on Mac option.

Installing =tart= via [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]] followed the typical =brew= command... a breeze via my trusty Emacs [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/complete-guide-mastering-eshell][eshell]]:

#+begin_src sh
  brew install cirruslabs/cli/tart
#+end_src

Cloning a VM image, while straightforward, it did take a little while for the chunky download:

#+begin_src sh
  tart clone ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-sonoma-base:latest sonoma-base
#+end_src

Running the macOS Sonoma VM was a breeze:

#+begin_src sh
  tart run sonoma-base
#+end_src

...and with that, I got a full (and disposable) macOS VM I can use to create another @icloud.com account:

While there may be simpler options out there to create an @icloud.com account (please do let me know [[https://indieweb.social/@xenodium][mastodon]]/[[https://twitter.com/xenodium][twitter]]), the VM did the job. I'd been meaning to find a low friction mechanism to run VMs for a different reason, but that's a post for another time.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 98%

I also wanted the ability to redact the entire buffer content, so feeding a space to the regexp query also translates to =[[:graph:]]=, effectively redacting all visible characters.

This sparked my interest as I previously looked into [[https://xenodium.com/emailing-pdfs-to-kindle-from-mu4e/][sending pdfs to my Kindle]] via [[https://github.com/djcb/mu][mu4e]].

Kindle offers a neat service where you can email a file to your =@kindle.com= address and it automatically shows up in your Kindle library.

I already do email from my beloved editor, and like most Emacs things, it's powered by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp][elisp]]. In other words, it's basically up for grabs if you'd like to glue it to anything else, so I did...

I can now select a region and invoke =M-x send-to-kindle-as-txt= to send it over to my Kindle.

While it looks kinda magical, it's fairly simple under the hood. It takes the region content, writes it to a txt file, creates an email message buffer attaching the file, and finally sends via =message-send-and-exit=.

If =M-x send-to-kindle-as-txt= is invoked with a =C-u= prefix, you get to inspect the message buffer right before sending via =C-c C-c=.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sha-256-hash-from-url-the-easy-way
:END:
From time to time, I need to generate a SHA-256 hash from a file hosted on some server. For me, this flow typically goes something along the lines of:

- Copy the file URL from browser.
- Drop to Emacs eshell.
- Change current directory.
- Type "curl -o file"
- Paste the file URL.
- Run curl command.
- Type "shasum -a 256 file".
- Run [[https://linux.die.net/man/1/shasum][shasum]] command.
- Copy the generated hash.
- Maybe delete the downloaded file?

We can maybe shave some steps off by downloading directly from the browser, though that may also bring additional clicks and navigating to a download location.

Amongst the steps, [[https://linux.die.net/man/1/shasum][shasum]] is the star player, and its output can be seen below.

#+begin_src bash

Not a huge deal. One can copy the hash from the output, but why go through multiple small manual steps when I know I can get Emacs to simplify the lot? I've expedited a similar flow in the past when [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-clone-git-repo-from-clipboard/][cloning git repos]]. Let's simplify again so hashing a hosted file boils down to:

- Copy the file URL from browser.
- Run an Emacs interactive command.

* [2023-09-05 Tue] Inline previous result and why you should edebug
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: inline-previous-result-and-why-you-should-edebug
:END:
Artur Malabarba's [[https://endlessparentheses.com/debugging-emacs-lisp-part-1-earn-your-independence.html][Debugging Elisp Part 1: Earn your independence]] is nearly a decade old, yet it rings just as true today.

Learning to Edebug really /"is the right decision for anyone who doesn't know how to Edebug."/ Why, you may ask? He best puts it as /"running into errors is not only a consequence of tinkering with your editor, it is the only road to graduating in Emacs."/

For me personally, it /earned me that independence/ to bend Emacs my way. Don't like how something works? Pull up the debugger to help me understand how a package or function works. I've done this countless of times to bend things my way.

Speaking of edebug, I had been meaning to tweak edebug's result display behaviour for quite some time. As you step through code, edbug prints the result of previous expressions to the minibuffer. This works well, but I couldn't help but feel like my eyes were constantly jumping between the code and the minibuffer at the bottom of the window.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%
[[file:images/inline-previous-result-and-why-you-should-edebug/edebug-minibuffer.gif]]

I wanted to minimize the eye jumping experience, so I figured I could likely bend things my way and print the result at point. How did I go about it? The same way I often do. Figure out what function is called for a given key binding via [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Key-Help.html][describe-key]] or my favourite replacement helpful-key from [[https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful][helpful.el]]. This led me to =edebug-next-mode= in =edebug.el=. At that point, I could have set a breakpoint in =edebug-next-mode= and eventually step into the relevant code, but hey we had a better clue. We knew that all output started with "Result:", so we could just search for that string in =edebug.el= instead. Jackpot! =edebug-compute-previous-result= and its adjacent =edebug-previous-result= are just the right functions:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun edebug-compute-previous-result (previous-value)
    (if edebug-unwrap-results
        (setq previous-value
              (edebug-unwrap* previous-value)))
    (setq edebug-previous-result
          (concat "Result: "
                  (edebug-safe-prin1-to-string previous-value)
                  (eval-expression-print-format previous-value))))

  (defun edebug-previous-result ()
    "Print the previous result."
    (interactive)
    (message "%s" edebug-previous-result))
#+end_src

We can see that =edebug-previous-result= invokes =message= which is responsible for displaying the debugged expression's result in the minibuffer. Modifying this functions behaviour would be enough to achieve inline display, but I also want to remove "Result:" from the displayed message. Neither of these functions offer configurability, so we'll resort to advising both functions. That is, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch][monkey patch]] them (errm I know... lovely).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun adviced:edebug-compute-previous-result (_ &rest r)
    "Adviced `edebug-compute-previous-result'."
    (let ((previous-value (nth 0 r)))
      (if edebug-unwrap-results
          (setq previous-value
                (edebug-unwrap* previous-value)))
      (setq edebug-previous-result
            (edebug-safe-prin1-to-string previous-value))))

  (advice-add #'edebug-compute-previous-result
              :around
              #'adviced:edebug-compute-previous-result)
#+end_src

=adviced:edebug-compute-previous-result= removes "Result:" in addition to dropping =(eval-expression-print-format previous-value)=, which I don't typically rely on.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (require 'eros)

  (defun adviced:edebug-previous-result (_ &rest r)
    "Adviced `edebug-previous-result'."
    (eros--make-result-overlay edebug-previous-result
      :where (point)

              :around
              #'adviced:edebug-previous-result)
#+end_src

=adviced:edebug-previous-result= is in charge of display via =message=, so all we need is some replacement. I initially played with [[https://github.com/auto-complete/popup-el][popup-tip]] and that [[https://indieweb.social/@xenodium/111008598580447299][did the job just fine]], but [[https://emacs.ch/@fosskers][Colin]] led me to a better path while [[https://emacs.ch/@fosskers/111009811997698187][pointing to Clojure and Common Lisp]]. This reminded me of [[https://github.com/xiongtx/eros][eros: Evaluation Result OverlayS for Emacs Lisp]], which I already used. Swapping =message= for =eros--make-result-overlay= did the trick. Yes, this is a private function, but I can live with that. This code is only an =advice-remove= away from disabling, but hey look at those /inline results/!

* [2023-08-22 Tue] My custom Tesco Clubcard pkpass
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: my-custom-tesco-clubcard-pkpass
:END:
My significant other and I had two plastic Tesco Clubcards. I lost mine, so I took a picture of hers. I was fairly certain a barcode photo would scan just as well at self-checkout, and it did.

This got me thinking about Apple's Wallet [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKPASS][pkpasses]]. I don't really know much about them. Could I potentially create my own =.pkpass=? If I could just include the same barcode as in the photo, it should do the job just fine.

Now I should mention, [[https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/tesco-grocery-clubcard/id389581236][Tesco does have an app on the App Store]]. If you just want the official Wallet pass on your iPhone, use that. But I was curious about whether or not I could create my own pass.

Turns out I /can/. I followed Apple's [[https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/PassKit_PG/YourFirst.html][building your first pass]] which runs you through [[https://developer.apple.com/help/account/configure-app-capabilities/create-wallet-identifiers-and-certificates][creating Wallet identifiers/certificates]], editing =pass.json=, and downloading/building [[https://developer.apple.com/services-account/download?path=/iOS/Wallet_Support_Materials/WalletCompanionFiles.zip][signpass]] (the utility used to sign =.pass= bundles).

The =signpass= utility is included in WalletCompanionFiles.zip, which comes with a handful of sample passes.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  WalletCompanionFiles
  │
  ├── SamplePasses
  │   │
  │   ├── BoardingPass.pass
  │   ├── Coupon.pass
  │   ├── Event.pass
  │   ├── Event.pkpass
  │   ├── Generic.pass
  │   └── StoreCard.pass
  │       │
  │       ├── pass.json
  │       └── ...
  └── signpass
#+end_src

Being a rewards card, I opted to look into =StoreCard.pass=, but like all other passes, the =barcode= itself is what makes each pass scannable. The barcode details are specified in the bundles's =pass.json= file. I needed to figure out the relevant values describing the Tesco barcode.

#+begin_src json
  "barcode": {
    "format": "???",
    "message": "???",
    "messageEncoding": "???"
  }
#+end_src

I had no clue what values I should use for a Tesco Clubcard. I did, however, have a photo of the barcode I needed. This is in fact what prompted looking into [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-scan-this-qrcode][scanning barcodes from Emacs]], which worked just great. It gave me all the crucial bits for the Clubcard.

#+begin_src json
  "barcode": {
    "format": "PKBarcodeFormatCode128",
    "message": "1234567890123456",  // not my actual Clubcard number of course.
    "messageEncoding": "iso-8859-1"
  }
#+end_src

That's all that's needed for the barcode section, the most useful part of the pass. We're not done though. We also need our registered Wallet identifiers, so the =signpass= utility can sign.

#+begin_src json
  "passTypeIdentifier": "my.com.identifier.passmaker", // also not my actual one.
  "teamIdentifier": "AAABBBCCCD", // nor this one.
#+end_src

We should be able to sign the pass with the following:

#+begin_src sh
  signpass -p StoreCard.pass
#+end_src

We're technically done. We now have a working card, but it looks just like the sample store card included in WalletCompanionFiles.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
[[file:images/my-custom-tesco-clubcard-pkpass/lemons.png]]

What's the fun in that? Now that I can make my own Clubcard, let's customize it!

For imagery, I replaced a couple of images in the .pass bundle:

#+begin_src c
  StoreCard.pass
  │
  ├── pass.json
  ├── icon.png
  ├── logo.png // replaced
  └── strip.png // replaced
#+end_src

I replaced =logo.png= using a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tesco_Logo.svg][Tesco logo I found on Wikipedia]]. I had initially removed =strip.png=, but that made the card feel a little empty. I was thinking of using a Tesco carrier bag to bulk the space up. While I didn't find a suitable bag image, I did land on "[[https://banksyexplained.com/very-little-helps-2008/][Very Little Helps, 2008]]". Using my limited [[https://www.gimp.org/][GIMP]] skills, I cropped one of the images and also replaced =strip.png=.

The remaining customizations took place in =pass.json= and should be fairly self-explanatory. There's the text shown in all labels as well as three customizable colours (background, label, and foreground).

#+begin_src json
  {
    "formatVersion": 1,
    "passTypeIdentifier": "my.com.identifier.passmaker", // also not my actual one.

    },

    "storeCard": {
      "auxiliaryFields": [
        {
          "key": "membership",
          "label": "Member since 2023",

        },
        {
          "key": "membership2",
          "label": "Expires sometime",
          "value": ""
        }
      ]
    }

* [2023-08-07 Mon] Extending sqlite-mode (cell navigation + edits)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sqlite-mode-goodies
:END:
I recently [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-29s-sqlite-mode/][wrote about Emacs 29's new sqlite-mode]], which enables you to browse sqlite databases from your beloved editor.

Out of the box, it supports the following browsing features:

- =sqlite-mode-list-data=: List the data from the table under point.
- =sqlite-mode-list-column=: List the columns of the table under point.
- =sqlite-mode-list-tables=: Re-list the tables from the currently selected database.

On the editing side of things it supports row deletion:

- =sqlite-mode-delete=: Delete the row under point.

While fairly spartan, it lays foundations for additional tools and features.

Two features I would like to have:

1. TAB navigation across table rows and columns.
2. Updating the row's field at point.

This would give me the familiar behaviour I'm used to in my org tables as well as other common spreadsheet tools.

Luckily, this is Emacs, so we can bend it our way... and I sure did!

Here's tab navigating forward:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75%
[[file:images/sqlite-mode-goodies/sqlite-forward.gif]]

Here's tab navigating backward:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75%
[[file:images/sqlite-mode-goodies/sqlite-previous.gif]]

And updating row fields:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 90%
[[file:images/sqlite-mode-goodies/sqlite-edits.gif]]

Most of the navigation is achieved by querying the current buffer to figure out column positions. Editing was in some ways easier, as I looked at =sqlite-mode-delete= to figure out how it handled the query.

To get the more familiar navigation behaviour, I've adjusted my key bindings as follows:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (use-package sqlite-mode-extras
    :bind (:map
           sqlite-mode-map
           ("n" . next-line)
           ("p" . previous-line)
           ("<backtab>" . sqlite-mode-extras-backtab-dwim)
           ("<tab>" . sqlite-mode-extras-tab-dwim)
           ("RET" . sqlite-mode-extras-ret-dwim)))
#+end_src

The code for =sqlite-mode-extras-tab-dwim=, =sqlite-mode-extras-backtab-dwim=, and =sqlite-mode-extras-ret-dwim= is little rough still (hacky even), but hey still fun.

For now, the code lives in [[https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/ar/sqlite-mode-extras.el][sqlite-mode-extras.el]] under my [[https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/tree/main][Emacs config repo]]. Improvements/fixes totally welcome!

Pressing =RET= on a table shows its content via =sqlite-mode-list-data=. =DEL= does as you'd expect and delete a row via =sqlite-mode-delete=.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: emacs-scan-this-qrcode
:END:
Another day, another tool brought to my Emacs fingertips. A while ago, I wrote about easily [[https://xenodium.com/copy-from-desktop-to-mobile-via-qr-code/][copying text from desktop to mobile via QR codes]]. Later on, I brought it under [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]] as [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/67da65f97d7f5477e19407d25887c23fab31517d/dwim-shell-commands.el#L593][dwim-shell-commands-clipboard-to-qr]].

This time around, I needed the opposite: to scan a code from an image file. This is where [[https://github.com/mchehab/zbar][zbar]]'s =zbarimg= comes in. These days, I'm mostly on macOS, so I installed via [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]]:

#+begin_src sh
  $ brew install zbar
#+end_src

There's really nothing to the command. You feed it an image, and it outputs the scanned details. Perfect.

#+begin_src sh
  $ zbarimg path/to/code-128.png
  CODE-128:hello world
  scanned 1 barcode symbols from 1 images in 0.02 seconds
#+end_src

The only challenge is my brain. I probably won't remember the name of this wonderful tool next time I need it, so I'll just add it to my [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-commands.el][dwim-shell-commands.el arsenal]] with a memorable name:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun dwim-shell-commands-image-scan-code ()
    "Scan any code from image(s)."
    (interactive)
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "Scan code"
     "zbarimg '<<f>>'"
     :utils "zbarimg"))
#+end_src

In the future, rather than reaching out to =zbarimg= directly, I'll use my trusty fuzzy search and... voilà!

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 85%

I guess that's what some refer to as [[https://medium.com/@ericclemmons/javascript-fatigue-48d4011b6fc4#.prcj59904][Javascript Fatigue]].

I'm giving JavaScript another try, but this time with an Emacs [[https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell][chatgpt-shell]] standing by. Reentering the JavaScript world as a noob, I often know what I want to enable, but I'm unfamiliar with which project knobs to turn to set things up.

While I may want to dig deeper into things in the future, at present I just want to dabble with JavaScript. I want a local project set up as quickly as possible. ChatGPT has been pretty handy at that. The Emacs ChatGPT shell and its minibuffer prompts work fairly well for my needs, yet I often found myself wishing it could behave more like a [[https://magit.vc/][magit]] commit buffer. That is, launch a dedicated buffer (not the shell itself), ask the question, maybe paste some snippets, and send it on its way with that oh so familiar and satisfying =C-c C-c= binding ([[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Sending-Mail.html][sending mail]] also says hello).

This is where =M-x chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose= comes in. It's a mash between the ChatGPT shell and a magit commit buffer:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 85%
[[file:images/a-cure-for-javascript-fatigue/node-chatgpt.gif]]

In the background, the buffer is still powered by the shell itself, so you can reuse it to ask clarifying questions.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 85%
[[file:images/a-cure-for-javascript-fatigue/compose.gif]]

A couple of additional features worth mentioning... Invoking =chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose= with an active region automatically copies the region content over to the compose buffer. This is handy if you'd like to create more elaborate prompts with further editing. So far, this feels more natural than editing text from the shell or the minibuffer, where =RET= doesn't insert new lines.

The compose buffer is powered by a background shell (storing history for us). Typing =clear= followed by =C-c C-c= clears the background shell history.

=chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose= is available in [[https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell][chatgpt-shell]] v0.72.1. I've so far bound it to =C-c C-e=, though I've already found some unfortunate clashes.

Luckily, we also have the built-in Emacs psychotherapist we can chat to, courtesy of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Amusements.html][M-x doctor]]. It's powered by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp][elisp]], and like all Emacs things, it's basically up for grabs. What I mean is, elisp implements many of these features, but also glues the lot for you. Once you learn a little elisp, you can build new Emacs features but also glue others for that magical compound effect.

[[file:images/chatgpt-visits-the-emacs-doctor/got-a-problem.gif]]

A little while ago, I wanted to give [[https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt][ChatGPT]] a try, preferably from Emacs (of course). I figured a shell interface would be a great fit for the interaction. Emacs already shipped with a general command interpreter ([[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shell-Prompts.html][comint]]), so I cobbled together a [[https://xenodium.com/a-chatgpt-emacs-shell/][ChatGPT Emacs shell]].

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75%
#+CAPTION: [[https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell][chatgpt-shell]]

So where am I going with all this? The fine netizens [[https://www.reddit.com/user/emaphis/][r/emaphis]] and [[https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=salgernon][salgernon]] both planted a great seed:

 - /"[[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/11wdub9/comment/jczrlt7][Now for extra-credit, add the ability for Alt-X doctor to psychoanalyze Chat-GPT]]"/.
 - /"[[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35259022][So how about a quick M-x psychoanalyze-chatgpt?]]"/

I haven't forgotten about you. Let's take [[https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell][chatgpt-shell]], /M-x doctor/, our versatile elisp glue, and let's make them talk:

#+CAPTION: courtesy of [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/122nm9r/comment/jdv9f1i][thriveth]] and [[https:/asset.dr.dk/imagescaler01/downol.dr.dk/download/bonanza/thumbs/000026814.jpg][dr.dk]].
[[file:images/chatgpt-visits-the-emacs-doctor/000026814.jpg]]

There isn't too much to the code, but beware:

1. If you want to run it, you'll need chatgpt-shell [[https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell#install][installed and set up]].
2. This was a quick fun hack. No code judging ;)


The snippet is further down... Start with =chatgpt-shell-visit-doctor= as the entry point, setting things up for us. It creates both the =*chatgpt*= and =*doctor*= buffers and arranges the windows next to each other.

We also set a ChatGPT system prompt to guide things a little:

#+begin_quote
  "Pretend to be an overwhelmed Emacs user who is obsessed with configuring their init.el file. You are in a session talking to a psychotherapist. Limit your output to no more than 20 words. In the course of 5 exchanges between you and the therapist, show improvements. On the 8th exchange after therapist speaks, declare you are cured and only output 'Thank you doc, I think I'm cured!'"
#+end_quote

ChatGPT and Emacs doctor can go on and on, so we limit ChatGPT responses to 20 words per response and 8 exchanges. We don't want the session to abruptly end without a resolution, so we'll use /Thank you doc, I think I'm cured!/ as our key phrase to end the session.

We register =chatgpt-shell--on-chatgpt-patient-response= as a hook to receive ChatGPT output, which we feed to the =*doctor*= buffer. We subsequently get a doctor response that's fed back to ChatGPT via =chatgpt-shell--insert-doc-response=.

We add some additional freebies like binding =Ctrl-c Ctrl-c= to =chatgpt-shell-leave-doctor=, so we can bail out of the exchange from the =*chatgpt*= buffer.

We also introduced =chatgpt-shell--insert-delayed-text= as a replacement for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Insertion.html][insert]] to slow things down a little. For visual effects, really.

If you'd like to take a closer look for analysis, here's the official transcript of this fruitful session:

#+begin_quote
I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time you are finished talking, type RET twice.


I spend hours tweaking my Emacs config, but it's never perfect. I'm overwhelmed and obsessed with customization.


Is it because it's not ever perfect you are overwhelmed and obsessed with customization that you came to me?


Yes, I can't stop myself from constantly trying to tweak and improve my Emacs configuration. It's consuming me.


Emacs?  Hah!  I would appreciate it if you would continue.


Sorry about that. Yes, I came to you because I'm overwhelmed by my obsession with customizing my Emacs configuration.


Does it bother you that you are overwhelmed by your obsession with customizing your emacs configuration?


Absolutely! I feel trapped in an endless cycle of tweaking and configuring, unable to achieve satisfaction.


Why do you say that?


I constantly seek perfection in my Emacs config, but it's an unattainable goal that leaves me exhausted and frustrated.


When did you first know that it's an unattainable goal that leaves you exhausted and frustrated?


I've realized it recently after spending countless hours trying to perfect my Emacs configuration without any lasting satisfaction.


Are you sure?


Thanks you doc, I think I'm cured.
#+end_quote

While we can work exclusively with the =*doctor*= buffer making requests directly to the ChatGPT API, where's the fun in that? Getting the buffers to talk to each other enables us to marvel at both the beauty and absurdity of being able to glue anything together in our lovely Emacs world.

Happy Emacsing!

* [2023-07-09 Sun] chatgpt-shell v0.60.1 updates
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: chatgpt-shell-v0601-updates
:END:

Back in April, I shared [[https://xenodium.com/chatgpt-shell-available-on-melpa/][chatgpt-shell updates]], showcasing [[https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell][chatgpt-shell]] features. It's been a little while, so here's an update with the latest additions.

Like this project? Consider ✨[[https://github.com/sponsors/xenodium][sponsoring]]✨.

** Multi-session support
You can run multiple shell instances independently configured to use different versions or system prompts.

This was biggest recent change. Please report issues.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 95%
[[file:images/chatgpt-shell-v0601-updates/cat-turtle.gif]]

** Display system prompt and version

The current shell's version and system prompt are now displayed more prominently in both the shell prompt and buffer name.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 90%
[[file:images/chatgpt-shell-v0601-updates/display.png]]

With multi-session support, displaying shell details in the buffer name becomes more important as it makes it easier to find shells across your buffer list.

** Rename shell buffers

While buffer names are now automatically derived, one can also use =chatgpt-shell-rename-buffer= to use custom buffer names.

** ob-chatgpt-shell improvements

Use =:temperature= to specify the [[https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions\
/create#completions/create-temperature][temperature]].

Use =:context CONTEXT-NAME= to pick and choose which source blocks to aggregate as context. Thank you [[https://github.com/jtmoulia][Thomas Moulia]].

Use =:preflight t= to debug =ob-chatgpt-shell= execution.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%
[[file:images/chatgpt-shell-v0601-updates/preflight.png]]

** chatgpt-shell-write-git-commit

Adds =chatgpt-shell-write-git-commit=, so you can generate commit messages using the current region. Thank you [[https://github.com/bigsky77][Simon Judd]].

** Approximate context length

=chatgpt-shell= now uses =chatgpt-shell--approximate-context-length= to approximate the context size and discard history if necessary. This is pretty experimental but seems to work well enough. It's enabled by default to get some feedback. Please file bugs if needed or send PRs to improve.

**  =S-<return>= for multiline input

In addition to =C-J= to insert multi-line input, =S-<return>= is also supported. Thank you [[https://github.com/shouya][shouya]] for the submission.

** Welcome message

A welcome message now makes the help much more discoverable for new or sporadic users. Thank you [[https://github.com/shouya][shouya]] for the suggestion.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75%
[[file:images/chatgpt-shell-v0601-updates/welcome.png]]

** Help me

While the [[https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell][README]] documents the shells and Emacs is [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SelfDocumentation][self-documenting]], we now have a =help= command to make things a little more discoverable.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 99%
[[file:images/chatgpt-shell-v0601-updates/help.png]]

** Hello chatgpt-shell-mode and dall-e-shell-mode

Both =chatgpt-shell= and =dall-e-shell= are both based on =shell-maker= and until recently both shared =shell-maker-mode= as their major mode. This didn't play well with yasnippet. Both shells now enable independent major modes: =chatgpt-shell-mode= and =dall-e-shell-mode=. Thank you [[https://github.com/djliden][Daniel Liden]] for the proposal.

** Saving transcript customizations

Make transcript saving more customizable via =shell-maker-transcript-default-path= and =shell-maker-transcript-default-filename=. Thank you [[https://github.com/gnusupport][gnusupport]].

** New ChatGPT model versions

New OpenAI model versions were recently released and added to chatgpt-shell: =gpt-3.5-turbo-0613= and =gpt-4-0613=. Thanks you [[https://github.com/suzuki][Norio Suzuki]].

** Load awesome prompts

=M-x chatgpt-shell-load-awesome-prompts= to download and import curated prompts from [[https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts][awesome-chatgpt-prompts]]. Thank you [[https://github.com/dangom][Daniel Gomez]].

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75%
[[file:images/chatgpt-shell-v0601-updates/awesome.png]]

** ob-async

We had reports that ob-chatgpt-shell didn't play nice with [[https://github.com/astahlman/ob-async][ob-async]]. Thank you [[https://github.com/wmedrano][William Medrano]] for the solution.

** Configurable prompts

Functions like =chatgpt-shell-describe-code= ask ChatGPT to describe the code in region. These functions used hardcoded English prompts. These are now configurable, so users can tweak or translate if preferred. Thank you [[https://github.com/suzuki][Norio Suzuki]].

- =chatgpt-shell-prompt-header-describe-code=
- =chatgpt-shell-prompt-header-refactor-code=

[[http://www.dyerdwelling.family/][James Dyer]] has a nice [[https://www.emacs.dyerdwelling.family/emacs/20230606213531-emacs--dired-duplicate-here-revisited/][post]] sharing his frequent [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]] need to duplicate files. He offers a solution using a custom interactive command. His use-case resonated with me.

Similarly, James' recommendation to bind his file-duplicating command to =C-c d= [1] sent a signal to my brain triggering [[https://twitter.com/bbatsov][Bozhidar Batsov]]'s =crux-duplicate-current-line-or-region=.

=crux-duplicate-current-line-or-region= is part of a "collection of Ridiculously useful extensions for Emacs" (yeah that's [[https://github.com/bbatsov/crux][crux]]). The command itself does what it says on the tin.

Let's duplicate the current line.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 95%
[[file:images/duplicate-this/duplicate-line.gif]]

Now let's duplicate the current region.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 95%
[[file:images/duplicate-this/duplicate-region.gif]]

Since I already have a well-internalized key-binding duplicating lines/regions in text buffers, I could extend a similar behaviour to dired files with almost zero adoption effort.

In case you haven't noticed, I've made it a [[https://youtu.be/urcL86UpqZc?t=177][part-time job]] to make command line utilities easily accessible from Emacs ([[https://xenodium.com/joining-images-from-the-comfort-of-dired/][1]] [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-dwim-shell-command/][2]] [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-password-protect-current-pdf-revisited/][3]] [[https://xenodium.com/dwim-shell-command-now-on-windows/][4]] [[https://xenodium.com/recordscreenshot-windows-the-lazy-way/][5]] [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-ffmpeg-and-macos-alias-commands/][6]] [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-quick-kill-process/][7]] [[https://xenodium.com/hey-emacs-change-the-default-macos-app-for/][8]] [[https://xenodium.com/hey-emacs-where-did-i-take-that-photo/][9]] [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-open-with-macos-app/][10]] [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-macos-sharing-dwim-style-improved/][11]] [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-macos-share-from-dired-dwim-style/][12]] [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-reveal-in-finder-dwim-style/][13]] [[https://xenodium.com/dwim-shell-command-usages-pdftotext-and-scp/][14]] [[https://xenodium.com/dwim-shell-command-with-template-prompts/][15]] [[https://xenodium.com/seamless-command-line-utils/][16]] [[https://xenodium.com/dwim-shell-command-video-streams/][17]] [[https://xenodium.com/dwim-shell-command-improvements/][18]] [[https://xenodium.com/dwim-shell-command-on-melpa/][19]] [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-dwim-shell-command-multi-language/][20]] [[https://xenodium.com/png-to-icns-emacs-dwim-style/][21]]) via [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]]. Partly because it's fairly quick and partly 'cause it's fun.

Jame's post gave me yet another opportunity to exercise my errrm part-time job. This time, duplicating files. All I need is the [[https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cp.1.html][cp]] utility and a template:

#+begin_src sh
  cp -R '<<f>>' '<<f(u)>>'
#+end_src

I seldom type these template's myself when I want to execute a command (via =M-x dwim-shell-command=). I typically wrap these templates in interactive commands, making them easily accessible via =M-x= and your favorite completion framework. I happen to use [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (require 'dwim-shell-command)

  (defun dwim-shell-commands-duplicate ()
    "Duplicate file(s)."
    (interactive)
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "Duplicate file(s)."
     "cp -R '<<f>>' '<<f(u)>>'"
     :utils "cp"))
#+end_src

There's nothing much to the command. Most logic is handled by the template, replacing =<<f>>= with the current file and =<<f(u)>>= with a uniquified version of it. Having said this, there's a bunch of free [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-dwim-do-what-i-mean/][DWIM]] love that kicks in, courtesy of the =dwim-shell-command= package by yours truly. Let's give our new =dwim-shell-commands-duplicate= command a spin.

Like =crux-duplicate-current-line-or-region= duplicates the current line, our new command duplicates the current dired file.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 95%
[[file:images/duplicate-this/duplicate-file.gif]]

Got multiple files to duplicate? Like =crux-duplicate-current-line-or-region=, we can use the region for a similar purpose.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 95%
[[file:images/duplicate-this/duplicate-files.gif]]

While we have been using the region to duplicate adjacent files, we can also mark specific files.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 95%
[[file:images/duplicate-this/duplicate-marked.gif]]

Our =cp -R '<<f>>' '<<f(u)>>'= template uses the =-R= (recursive) flag, so we get another freebie. In addition to files, we can also duplicate directories.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 95%
[[file:images/duplicate-this/duplicate-dirs.gif]]

Lastly, because we're on a DWIM train, if your current buffer happens to be visiting a file, you can =M-x dwim-shell-commands-duplicate= the current file to duplicate it. You're automatically dropped to a dired buffer, with point on the new file (à la [[https://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/09/24/dired-jump/][dired-jump]]).

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 95%
[[file:images/duplicate-this/duplicate-buffer.gif]]

While duplicating files using a template was a mere =cp -R '<<f>>' '<<f(u)>>'= away, we get a bunch of free DWIM magic applied to a handful of use-cases and contexts. What made the file-duplicating use-case extra special is that it maps almost exactly to an equivalent text command. Keep the same key bindings and we almost get a "[[https://endlessparentheses.com/hungry-delete-mode.html][free feature]]".

* [2023-06-29 Thu] Stitching images from the comfort of dired
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: joining-images-from-the-comfort-of-dired
:END:
I recently wanted a few images stitched together. A perfect job for [[https://imagemagick.org/][ImageMagick]]. A quick search yielded the magical incantation:

#+begin_src sh
  convert image1.jpg image2.jpg image3.jpg +append joined.jpg
#+end_src

Great, now I know, but I'll rarely use it and will soon forget it. I may as well add it to my [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-commands.el][repository]] of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM][DWIM]] command line utilities, wrapped in a convenient Emacs function, applicable from different contexts... [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-dwim-do-what-i-mean/][know what I mean]]? 🙃

I built [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]] for this purpose. You can take the above command and easily turn it into an interactive Emacs command with something like the following:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (require 'dwim-shell-command)

  (defun dwim-shell-commands-join-images-horizontally ()
    "Join all marked images horizontally as a single image."
    (interactive)
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "Join images horizontally"
     "convert -verbose '<<*>>' +append 'joined.jpg'"
     :utils "convert"))
#+end_src

You can select as many images as you'd like from the comfort of your dired and /make the ImageMagick happen/.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 95%
[[file:images/joining-images-from-the-comfort-of-dired/burgers.gif]]

The snippet does the job just fine, but we can make it smarter. For starters, let's not hardcode the output filename. We'll ask the user instead. While we're asking, let's offer a default filename, but let's not assume the output extension is =.jpg=. Let's guess based on the image selection. While we're at it, let's not override the output file if already exists. Uniquify it.

Most of the above can be achieved by either using [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]] helpers or its templating language. For example, =<<joined.png(u)>>= ensures that if =joined.png= already exists, it automatically generates =joined(1).png= instead.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (require 'dwim-shell-command)

  (defun dwim-shell-commands-join-images-horizontally ()
    "Join all marked images horizontally as a single image."
    (interactive)
    (let ((filename (format "joined.%s"
                            (or (seq-first (dwim-shell-command--file-extensions)) "png"))))
      (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
       "Join images horizontally"
       (format "convert -verbose '<<*>>' +append '<<%s(u)>>'"
               (dwim-shell-command-read-file-name
                (format "Join as image named (default \"%s\"): " filename)
                :default filename))
       :utils "convert")))
#+end_src

Here's the new horizontal command in action...

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 95%
[[file:images/joining-images-from-the-comfort-of-dired/burger_row_x1.5_optimized.gif]]

Notice how this time we didn't mark the images using =dired-mark=, typically bound to =m=. Instead, we made our selection using the region. Also, if you haven't gotten your junk food fix yet, here's the fries equivalent ;)

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 95%
[[file:images/joining-images-from-the-comfort-of-dired/fries_row_x1.5_optimized.gif]]

We'll rinse all and repeat to get the vertical command equivalent. I know, I know, there's fair amount of duplication but c'est la vie.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (require 'dwim-shell-command)

  (defun dwim-shell-commands-join-images-vertically ()
    "Join all marked images vertically as a single image."
    (interactive)
    (let ((filename (format "joined.%s"
                            (or (seq-first (dwim-shell-command--file-extensions)) "png"))))
      (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
       "Join images vertically"
       (format "convert -verbose '<<*>>' -append '<<%s(u)>>'"
               (dwim-shell-command-read-file-name
                (format "Join as image named (default \"%s\"): " filename)
                :default filename))
       :utils "convert")))
#+end_src

...and for our grand finale, we'll vertically join our burgers and fries. Behold!

* [2023-06-18 Sun] noweb: the lesser known org babel glue
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: noweb-more-glue-for-your-org-toolbox
:END:
While [[https://orgmode.org/][Org]] babel's [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Noweb-Reference-Syntax.html][noweb]] isn't something I've frequently used for literate programming, its simplicity makes it rather versatile to glue all sorts of babel things I hadn't previously considered.

The idea is simple. Add a placeholder like =<<other-block>>= to an [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Working-with-Source-Code.html][org babel]] source block, and it will be automatically replaced (verbatim) with the content (or result) of referred block before execution. You'll also need the =:noweb yes= header argument.

#+begin_src org
  ,#+NAME: other-block
  ,#+begin_src swift
    print("Hello 0")
  ,#+end_src

  ,#+RESULTS: other-block
  : Hello 0

  ,#+BEGIN_SRC swift :noweb yes
    <<other-block>>
    print("Hello 1")
  ,#+END_SRC

  ,#+RESULTS:
  : Hello 0
  : Hello 1
#+end_src

Since =<<other-block>>= is replaced with the content of said block, at execution time, the block is effectively equivalent to executing:

#+BEGIN_SRC swift
  print("Hello 0")
  print("Hello 1")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Hello 0
: Hello 1

Why is this so versatile? Org babel can include/execute all sorts of languages, so you can mix and match the result from one language and massage it to appear as the body of another block using the same (or different) language.

I was recently asked [[https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/issues/102][how to include the result from one babel block in another]] using [[https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/#chatgpt-org-babel][ob-chatgpt-shell]]. While the initial question was looking for a solution involving variables, we can use noweb to achieve a similar goal.

Note that in this case, I'll be using =<<hello()>>=, with =()=, to refer to =#+RESULTS:= rather than the source block itself.

#+begin_src org
  ,#+NAME: hello
  ,#+BEGIN_SRC chatgpt-shell
  Say hello in spanish
  ,#+END_SRC

  ,#+RESULTS: hello
  Hola

  ,#+BEGIN_SRC chatgpt-shell :noweb yes
  <<hello()>>
  What does the previous line say verbatim?
  ,#+END_SRC
#+end_src

Executing the block

#+BEGIN_SRC chatgpt-shell :noweb yes
<<hello()>>
What does the previous line say verbatim?
#+END_SRC

Gives us

#+RESULTS:
: The previous line says "Hola".

On a similar note, I was asked if the results from a previous source block could be [[https://indieweb.social/@kickingvegas@sfba.social/110562099134297469][fed to a Swift Chart block]] using [[https://github.com/xenodium/ob-swiftui][ob-swiftui]].

While I'm new to [[https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Charts][Swift Charts]], I do love glueing things via Emacs lisp. I figured I could write a little elisp to generate random data and feed it to a SwiftUI block via =<<data()>>=. The result is pretty neat, based on Apple's [[https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts/linemark][LineMark example]].

        self.city = city
        self.date = calendar.date(from: DateComponents(year: 2020, month: month))!
        self.hoursOfSunshine = hoursOfSunshine
      }
    }

    struct ContentView: View {
      var data: [MonthlyHoursOfSunshine] = [

While I've shown fairly basic usages of noweb, we can accomplish some nifty integrations. Check out the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Noweb-Reference-Syntax.html][noweb reference syntax]] for more examples and additional header arguments like =tangle=, =strip-tangle=, and others.

* [2023-05-25 Thu] Deleting from Emacs sequence vars
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: deleting-from-emacs-sequence-vars
:END:
Adding hooks and setting variables is core to customizing Emacs. Take a major mode like
=emacs-lisp-mode= as an example. To customize its behaviour, one may add a hook function to =emacs-lisp-mode-hook=, or if you're a little lazy while experimenting, you may even use a lambda.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook
            #'my/emacs-lisp-mode-config)

  (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (message "I woz ere")))
#+end_src

=emacs-lisp-mode-hook='s content would subsequently look as follows:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  '(my/emacs-lisp-mode-config
    (lambda nil
      (message "I woz ere"))
    ert--activate-font-lock-keywords
    easy-escape-minor-mode
    lisp-extra-font-lock-global-mode)
#+end_src

Maybe =my/emacs-lisp-mode-config= didn't work out for us and we'd like to remove it. We can use =remove-hook= for that and evaluate something like:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (remove-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook #'my/emacs-lisp-mode-config)
#+end_src

The lambda can be removed too, but you ought to be careful in using the same lambda body.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (remove-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (message "I woz tere")))
#+end_src

There are other ways to remove the lambdas, but we're digressing here... We typically have to write these throwaway snippets to undo our experiments. What if we just had a handy helper always available to remove items from sequences /(edit: we do, =remove-hook= is already interactive, see Update 2 below)/? After all, hooks are just lists (sequences).

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%
[[file:images/deleting-from-emacs-sequence-vars/removed-lambda.gif]]

While the interactive command can likely be simplified further, I tried to optimize for ergonomic usage. For example, =completing-read= gives us a way narrow down whichever variable we'd like to modify as well as the item we'd like to remove. =seqp= is also handy, as we filter out noise by automatically removing any variable that's not a sequence.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun ar/remove-from-list-variable ()
    (interactive)
    (let* ((var (intern
                 (completing-read "From variable: "

                                    (mapatoms
                                     (lambda (sym)
                                       (when (and (boundp sym)
                                                  (seqp (symbol-value sym)))
                                         (push sym symbols))))
                                    symbols) nil t)))
           (values (mapcar (lambda (item)
                             (setq item (prin1-to-string item))
                             (concat (truncate-string-to-width
                                      (nth 0 (split-string item "\n"))
                                      (window-body-width))
                                     (propertize item 'invisible t)))
                           (symbol-value var)))
           (index (progn
                    (when (seq-empty-p values) (error "Already empty"))
                    (seq-position values (completing-read "Delete: " values nil t)))))
      (unless index (error "Eeek. Something's up."))
      (set var (append (seq-take (symbol-value var) index)
                       (seq-drop (symbol-value var) (1+ index))))
      (message "Deleted: %s" (truncate-string-to-width
                              (seq-elt values index)
                              (- (window-body-width) 9)))))

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sprinkle-me-logs
:END:
At times, basic prints/logs are just about the right debugging strategy. Sure, we have debuggers and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop][REPLs]] which are super useful, but sometimes you just know that sprinkling your code with a handful of temporary prints/logs will get you enough info to fix an issue.

I must confess, my temporary print statements are fairly uninspiring. Sometimes I log the name of the method/function, but I also resort to less creative options like =print("Yay")= or =print("Got here")=.

My laziness and lack of creativity knows no boundaries, so if I need multiple unique entries, I often copy, paste, and append numbers to my entries: =print("Yay 2")=, =print("Yay 3")=, =print("Yay 4")=... I know, are you judging yet?

So rather than develop the creative muscle, I've decided to lean on laziness and old habits, so let's make old habit more efficient :) I no longer want to copy, paste, and increment my uncreative log statements. Instead, I'll let Emacs do it for me!

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%

There isn't a whole lot to the implementation. It searches the current buffer for other instances of the same logging string and captures the largest counter found. It subsequently prints the same string with the counter incremented. This can be done in a few lines of elisp, but I figure I wanted some additional features like auto indenting and changing the logging string when using a prefix.

I'm sure there's a package out there that does something similar, but I figure this would be a fun little elisp hack.

You can now use [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]] on Windows. Shoutout to Kartik Saranathan, who sent a [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/pull/9][pull request]] to get rid of =ls= usage.

Also thanks to Bram for sharing his [[https://indieweb.social/@bram85@emacs.ch/110335134760990713][upload to 0x0.st implementation]]. I'd been wanting to do something similar for [[https://imgur.com/][imgur]], but [[https://0x0.st/][0x0.st]] is a much better alternative!

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%
[[file:images/dwim-shell-command-now-on-windows/0x0.gif]]

=dwim-shell-commands-upload-to-0x0= is now part of [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/commit/1a896221cc34319582b0921b919638ea2528b0e6][dwim-shell-commands.el]] (the optional part of the package). It has a couple of additional touches:

- Open the uploaded image in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/EWW.html][eww]] browser.
- Automatically copy the upload URL to kill-ring. You're likely gonna share this link, right?

If you're unfamiliar with =dwim-shell-command=, it enables Emacs shell commands with DWIM behaviour:

- Asynchronously.
- Using noweb templates.
- Automatically injecting files (from [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]] or other buffers) or kill ring.
- Managing buffer focus with heuristics.
- Showing progress bar.
- Quick buffer exit.
- More reusable history.

In addition to replacing =shell-command= with =dwim-shell-command=, I also use it to bring all sorts of command line utilities to familiar Emacs workflows (in dired or current buffers), without having to remember complex command invocations.

I've covered many of the use-cases before:

* [2023-04-28 Fri] Generating elisp org docs
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: generating-elisp-org-docs
:END:
[[https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell][chatgpt-shell]]'s README includes few org tables documenting the package's [[https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell#chatgpt-shell-customizations][customizable variables]] as well as [[https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell#chatgpt-shell-commands][available commands]]. Don't worry, this isn't really another ChatGPT post.

Here's an extract of the docs table:

#+begin_src org :lexical no
  | Custom variable                       | Description                                                 |
  |---------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------|
  | chatgpt-shell-display-function        | Function to display the shell.                              |
  | chatgpt-shell-curl-additional-options | Additional options for `curl' command.                      |
  | chatgpt-shell-system-prompt           | The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. |
#+end_src

While the table docs didn't take long to build manually, they quickly became out of sync with their elisp counterparts. Not ideal, as it'll require a little more careful maintenance in the future.

Emacs being the self-documenting editor that it is, I figured I should be able to extract customizable variables, commands, along with their respective docs, and generate these very same org tables.

I had no idea how to go about this, but [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Apropos.html][apropos-variable]] and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Apropos.html][apropos-command]] surely knew where to fetch the details from. A peak into =apropos.el= quickly got me on my way. Turns out [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Creating-Symbols.html#Definition-of-mapatoms][mapatoms]] is just what I needed. It iterates over [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Creating-Symbols.html][obarray]], Emacs's symbol table. We can use it to extract the symbols we're after.

Since we're filtering symbols from =chatgpt-shell=, we can start by including only those whose =symbol-name= match "^chatgpt-shell". Out of all matching, we should only keep custom variables. We can use =custom-variable-p= to check for that. This gives us all relevant variables. We can subsequently get each variable's corresponding docs using =(get symbol 'variable-documentation)= and put it into a list.

Now, if we pull our org babel rabbit out of our Emacs magic hat, we can use =:results table= to print the list as an org table. The source block powering this magic trick looks as follows:

#+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results table :colnames '("Custom variable" "Description")
    (let ((rows))
      (mapatoms
       (lambda (symbol)
         (when (and (string-match "^chatgpt-shell"
                                  (symbol-name symbol))
                    (custom-variable-p symbol))
           (push `(,symbol
                   ,(car
                     (split-string
                      (or (get (indirect-variable symbol)
                               'variable-documentation)
                          (get symbol 'variable-documentation)
                          "")
                      "\n")))
                 rows))))
      rows)
  ,#+end_src
#+end_src

And just like that... we effortlessly get our elisp docs in an org table, straight from Emacs's symbol table.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 100%
[[file:images/generating-elisp-org-docs/docs.gif]]

It's worth noting that our snippet used =indirect-variable= to resolve aliases but also limited descriptions to the first line in each docstring.

To build a similar table for interactive commands, we can use the following block (also including bindings).

#+begin_src org
  ,#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results table :colnames '("Binding" "Command" "Description")
    (let ((rows))
      (mapatoms
       (lambda (symbol)
         (when (and (string-match "^chatgpt-shell"
                                  (symbol-name symbol))
                    (commandp symbol))
           (push `(,(mapconcat
                     #'help--key-description-fontified
                     (where-is-internal
                      symbol shell-maker-mode-map nil nil (command-remapping symbol)) ", ")
                   ,symbol
                   ,(car
                     (split-string
                      (or (documentation symbol t) "")
                      "\n")))
                 rows))))
      rows)
  ,#+END_SRC

:END:
About a month ago, I posted about an experiment to build [[https://xenodium.com/a-chatgpt-emacs-shell/][a ChatGPT Emacs shell]] using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shell-Prompts.html][comint mode]]. Since then, it's turned into a package of sorts, evolving with [[https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+][user feedback]] and [[https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed][pull requests]].

** Now on MELPA

While [[https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell][chatgpt-shell]] is a young package still, it seems useful enough to share more widely. As of today, =chatgpt-shell= is [[https://melpa.org/#/chatgpt-shell][available on MELPA]]. Many thanks to [[https://github.com/riscy][Chris Rayner]] for his MELPA guidance to get the package added.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%
[[file:images/chatgpt-shell-available-on-melpa/cyberpunk.gif]]

I'll cover some of the goodies included in the latest =chatgpt-shell=.

** Delegating to Org Babel

=chatgpt-shell= now evaluates Markdown source blocks by delegating to [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][org babel]]. I've had success with a handful of languages. In some instances, some babel headers may need overriding in =chatgpt-shell-babel-headers=.

Here's a Swift execution via babel, showing standard output.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%
[[file:images/chatgpt-shell-available-on-melpa/swift.gif]]

In addition to standard output, =chatgpt-shell= can now render blocks generating images. Here's a rendered SwiftUI layout via [[https://github.com/xenodium/ob-swiftui][ob-swiftui]].

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%
[[file:images/chatgpt-shell-available-on-melpa/swiftui.gif]]

Can also do diagrams. Here's [[https://ditaa.sourceforge.net/][ditaa]] in action.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%
[[file:images/chatgpt-shell-available-on-melpa/ditaa.gif]]

** Renaming blocks

At times, ChatGPT may forget to label source blocks or maybe you just want to name it differently... You can now rename blocks at point.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%
[[file:images/chatgpt-shell-available-on-melpa/rename.gif]]

** Send prompt/region

There are a handful of commands to send prompts from other buffers, including the region. For example =chatgpt-shell-explain-code=.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%
[[file:images/chatgpt-shell-available-on-melpa/explain-region.gif]]

- chatgpt-shell-refactor-code
- chatgpt-shell-proofread-doc
- chatgpt-shell-eshell-summarize-last-command-output
- chatgpt-shell-eshell-whats-wrong-with-last-command

** Saving/restoring transcript

You can save your current session to a transcript and restore later.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%
[[file:images/chatgpt-shell-available-on-melpa/restore.gif]]

** History improvements

[[https://www.n16f.net/][Nicolas Martyanoff]] has a great post on [[https://www.n16f.net/blog/making-ielm-more-comfortable/][making IELM More Comfortable]]. A couple of improvements that stood out for me were:


- Making the command history persistent.
- Searching history with =shell-maker-search-history= / =M-r= via =completing-read=.

=shell-maker-search-history=, coupled with your completion framework of choice, can be pretty handy. I happen to use Oleh Krehel's [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]].

** shell-maker (make your own AI shells)

While ChatGPT is a popular service, there are many others sprouting. Some are cloud-based, others local, proprietary, open source... In any case, it'd be great be able to hook on to them without much overhead. [[https://xenodium.com/a-shell-maker/][shell-maker]] should help with that. The first  =shell-maker= clients are =chatgpt-shell= and =dall-e-shell=.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%
[[file:images/chatgpt-shell-available-on-melpa/dalle.png]]

While I've built =dall-e-shell=, it'd be great to see what others can do with =shell-maker=. If you wire it up to anything, please get in touch ([[https://indieweb.social/@xenodium][Mastodon]] / [[https://twitter.com/xenodium][Twitter]] / [[https://www.reddit.com/user/xenodium][Reddit]] / [[mailto:me__AT__xenodium.com][Email]]).

** dall-e-shell, ob-chatgpt-shell, and ob-dall-e-shell (on MELPA too)

UPDATE: [[https://indieweb.social/@xenodium/110087011082546281][dall-e-shell]], [[https://indieweb.social/@xenodium/110130580337078002][ob-chatgpt-shell]], and [[https://indieweb.social/@xenodium/110142796865197004][ob-dall-e-shell]] are now available on MELPA also.

You've seen =dall-e-shell= in the previous section. Here's what =ob-chatgpt-shell= and =ob-dall-e-shell= look like in an [[https://orgmode.org/][org mode]] document:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70%
[[file:images/chatgpt-shell-available-on-melpa/babel.png]]

** How are you using =chatgpt-shell=?

Whether you are an existing =chatgpt-shell= user, or would like to give things a try, [[https://melpa.org/#/chatgpt-shell][installing from MELPA]] should generally make things easier for ya. As I mentioned, =chatgpt-shell= is a young package still. There are unexplored Emacs integrations out there. I'd love to hear about whatever you come up with ([[https://indieweb.social/@xenodium][Mastodon]] / [[https://twitter.com/xenodium][Twitter]] / [[https://www.reddit.com/user/xenodium][Reddit]] / [[mailto:me__AT__xenodium.com][Email]]).

* [2023-04-22 Sat] Recording and screenshotting windows: the lazy way
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: recordscreenshot-windows-the-lazy-way
:END:
While there's no substitution for great written documentation, a quick demo can go a long way in conveying what a tool if capable of doing or what a tip/trick can achieve.

If you've read a handful of my posts, you would have come across either a screenshot or a short clip with some demo. Historically, I've used the macOS's built-in utility invoked via =⌘ + Shift + 5=. It does a fine job for screenshots. For video captures, it's got a couple of small quirks.

** Record window

Unlike screenshots, macOS video capture cannot record a specific window. While you can select a region, it's easy to inadvertently include a portion of your wallpaper in the recording. Not a big deal, but I felt posted screencasts could look as clean as their screenshot counterparts if we could record the window alone.

Let's compare grabbing a region vs window alone. I know the clean look may be subjective, but see what I mean?

#+CAPTION: Capture region (includes wallpaper/background)
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
[[file:images/recordscreenshot-windows-the-lazy-way/record-bg.gif]]

#+CAPTION: Capture window only (ahhh, so clean)
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
[[file:images/recordscreenshot-windows-the-lazy-way/record.gif]]

** Cancel recording

macOS has a handy shortcut (=⌘ + Ctrl + Esc=) to stop recording. If you got your demo right, you're done. If not, you have one more step remaining (right click to delete the blooper).

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 40%
[[file:images/recordscreenshot-windows-the-lazy-way/delete.png]]

Also not a huge deal, but I was hoping for a single shortcut to stop recording _and_ also automatically discard. I haven't found one, but would love to hear if otherwise.

** macosrec enters the chat

I wanted more flexibility to build my own recording/screenshotting flows. A command line utility could be quite versatile at that, so I built [[https://github.com/xenodium/macosrec][macosrec]].

=macosrec= enables taking a screenshot or recording a window video entirely from the command line.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%
[[file:images/recordscreenshot-windows-the-lazy-way/macosrec.gif]]

** elisp glues the world

Command line utilities can be invoked in all sorts of ways, but I'm an Emacs nutter so you can see where this is going... I want Emacs key bindings to control the lot.

| C-c _ | Take screenshot of a window |
| C-c ( | Start recording window      |
| C-c ) | Stop recording window       |
| C-c 8 | Abort recording             |

Integrating command line utilities into Emacs and making them quickly accessible seems to have become a full-time hobby of mine. I kid, but it's become a pretty painless process for me. I built [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]] for that. If you've never heard of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM][DWIM]], it stands for "Do what I mean".

If it ever took you a little while to find the right command incantation to get things right, only to forget all about it next time you need it ([[https://xenodium.com/emacs-ffmpeg-and-macos-alias-commands][I'm looking at you ffmpeg]]), =dwim-shell-command= can help you easily save things for posterity and make them easily accessible in the future.

Since we're talking ffmpeg, here's all it takes to have gif conversion handy:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun dwim-shell-commands-video-to-gif ()
    "Convert all marked videos to gif(s)."
    (interactive)
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "Convert to gif"
     "ffmpeg -loglevel quiet -stats -y -i '<<f>>' -pix_fmt rgb24 -r 15 '<<fne>>.gif'"
     :utils "ffmpeg"))
#+end_src

There's no way I'll remember the ffmpeg command, but I can always fuzzy search my trusty commands with something like ="to gif"= and apply to either the current buffer file or any selected [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]] files.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%
[[file:images/recordscreenshot-windows-the-lazy-way/to-gif.png]]

So where am I going with this? I wrote DWIM shell commands for the bindings I previously described:

| C-c _ | =dwim-shell-commands-macos-screenshot-window=      |
| C-c ( | =dwim-shell-commands-macos-start-recording-window= |
| C-c ) | =dwim-shell-commands-macos-end-recording-window=   |
| C-c 8 | =dwim-shell-commands-macos-abort-recording-window= |

Out of all of commands, =dwim-shell-commands-macos-start-recording-window= is likely the most interesting one.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun dwim-shell-commands-macos-start-recording-window ()
    "Select and start recording a macOS window."
    (interactive)
    (let* ((window (dwim-shell-commands--macos-select-window))
           (path (dwim-shell-commands--generate-path "~/Desktop" (car window) ".mov"))
           (buffer-file-name path) ;; override so <<f>> picks it up
           (inhibit-message t))
      (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
         "Start recording a macOS window."
         (format
          "# record .mov
           macosrec --record '%s' --mov --output '<<f>>'
           # speed .mov up x1.5
           ffmpeg -i '<<f>>' -an -filter:v 'setpts=1.5*PTS' '<<fne>>_x1.5.<<e>>'
           # convert to gif x1.5
           ffmpeg -loglevel quiet -stats -y -i '<<fne>>_x1.5.<<e>>' -pix_fmt rgb24 -r 15 '<<fne>>_x1.5.gif'
           # speed .mov up x2
           ffmpeg -i '<<f>>' -an -filter:v 'setpts=2*PTS' '<<fne>>_x2.<<e>>'
           # convert to gif x2
           ffmpeg -loglevel quiet -stats -y -i '<<fne>>_x2.<<e>>' -pix_fmt rgb24 -r 15 '<<fne>>_x2.gif'"
          (cdr window))
         :silent-success t
         :monitor-directory "~/Desktop"
         :no-progress t
         :utils '("ffmpeg" "macosrec"))))
#+end_src

As you likely expect, this command invokes =macosrec= to start recording a window. The nifty part is that when it's done recording (and saving the .mov file), it automatically creates multiple variants. For starters, it creates x1.5 and x2 .mov videos, but it also generates their .gif counterparts.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%
[[file:images/recordscreenshot-windows-the-lazy-way/bunch.png]]

Let's recap here for a sec. You start recording a window video with =C-c (=, end with =C-c )=, and automagically have all these generated files waiting for you.

You can subsequently inspect any of the video candidates and pick the most appropriate variant. Discard whatever else you don't need.

The output bundle is tailored to my needs. Maybe you want to invoke [[https://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/][gifsycle]] for more optimized versions? Or maybe you want automatic webp generation via =ffmpeg=? DWIM does that I mean, so you likely have other plans...

=dwim-shell-commands-macos-start-recording-window= and all other DWIM commands are now included in [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-commands.el][dwim-shell-commands.el]], which ships optionally as part of [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]].

[[https://github.com/xenodium/macosrec][macosrec]] is also on GitHub, but if you want to be on your way, you can install via:

#+begin_src sh
  brew tap xenodium/macosrec
  brew install macosrec
#+end_src

This is my way to record and screenshot windows the lazy way. How would you tweak to make it yours?

:END:
While [[https://indieweb.social/@xenodium/110227186721704189][experimenting with delegating Markdown]] blocks to [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][Org babel]] in Emacs [[https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell][chatgpt-shell]], I resurrected [[https://github.com/xenodium/ob-swiftui][ob-swiftui]]. A package I had written to execute and render SwiftUI blocks in org babel.

[[https://github.com/xenodium/ob-swiftui][ob-swiftui]] has two modes of rendering SwiftUI blocks: =:results window=, which runs outside of Emacs in a native window and =:results file=, which renders and saves to a file. The latter can be viewed directly from Emacs.

=:results file= was a little clunky. That is, it hardcoded dimensions I had to manually modify if the canvas wasn't big enough. It was also a little slow.

The clunkyness really came through with my chatgpt-shell experiments, so I took a closer look and made a few changes to remove hardcoding and speeds things up.

The results ain't too shabby.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80%
[[file:images/ob-swiftui-updates/file-render.gif]]

Another tiny improvement is that if you'd like to compose a more complex layout made of multiple custom views, =ob-swiftui= now looks for a =ContentView= as that root view by default. Specifying another root view was already possible but it had to be explicitly requested via =:view= param.

You can now omit the =:view= param if you name the root view =ContentView=:

#+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_src swiftui
    struct ContentView: View {
      var body: some View {
          TopView()
          BottomView()
      }
    }

    struct TopView: View {
      var body: some View {
        Text("Top text")
      }
    }

    struct BottomView: View {
      var body: some View {
        Text("Bottom text")
      }
    }
  ,#+end_src
#+end_src

The improvements have been pushed to [[https://github.com/xenodium/ob-swiftui][ob-swiftui]] and will soon be picked up on [[https://melpa.org/#/ob-swiftui][melpa]].

I get the occasional question about my Emacs theme, font, and other eye candy. I'm always tickled and happy to share.
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80%
[[file:images/my-emacs-eye-candy/Emacs.png]]

It's been a while since I've made visually significant changes to my Emacs config. May as well briefly document for posterity...

** Nyan Mode
First things first. The adorable and colorful little fella in my mode line is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyan_Cat][Nyan Cat]] (if you dare, check the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2-TGUlwu4][meme video]]). Yes, I know it's sooo 2011, but it's 2023 and I still love the little guy hanging out in my Emacs mode line. I still get asked about it.

#+ATTR_HTML: :height 30px
[[file:images/my-emacs-eye-candy/Nyan.png]]

This fabulous feature comes to us via the great [[https://github.com/TeMPOraL/nyan-mode/][Nyan Mode]] package. If looks haven't convinced you, Nyan also packs scrolling functionality. Click anywhere in it.

Oh, and if you can't get enough of Nyan, there's also [[https://depp.brause.cc/zone-nyan/][zone-nyan]] for Emacs.

** Emacs Plus (macOS)
I should mention I'm running Emacs 28 on macOS via the excellent [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][Emacs Plus]] [[https://brew.sh/][homebrew]] recipe. These are all the options I enable.

#+begin_src sh
  brew install  emacs-plus@28 --with-imagemagick --with-no-frame-refocus --with-native-comp --with-savchenkovaleriy-big-sur-icon
#+end_src

*** Icon
Since we're talking eye candy, let's chat about =--with-savchenkovaleriy-big-sur-icon=. This Emacs Plus option enables Valeriy Savchenko's [[https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy/emacs-icons][wonderful icon]].

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
[[file:images/my-emacs-eye-candy/swap.png]]

*** Titlebar
I've enabled both transparent title bar as well as dark appearance, giving a minimal window decoration.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%
[[file:images/my-emacs-eye-candy/decoration.jpg]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-transparent-titlebar . t))
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-appearance . dark))
#+end_src

Note: both of these variables are prefixed =ns-= (macOS-only settings).

** Font (JetBrains Mono)

I've been on [[https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/][JetBrains Mono]] font for quite some time now. In the past, I've also been a fan of [[https://madmalik.github.io/mononoki/][Mononoki]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_(typeface)][Menlo]] (on macOS) or [[https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font][Meslo]] (similar elsewhere).

** Theme (Material)

I'm using the great [[https://github.com/cpaulik/emacs-material-theme][Material Theme for Emacs]], with a [[https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/790465b1824481b81bf5c6e08949128c13d76f95/emacs/features/fe-ui.el#L42][bunch of tweaks of my own]].

** Modeline tabs/ribbons (Moody)

The [[https://github.com/tarsius/moody][moody]] package adds a nice touch displaying mode line elements as tabs and ribbons.

** Modeline menus (Minions)

The [[https://github.com/tarsius/minions][minions]] package removes lots of minor mode clutter from the mode line and stashes it away in menus.

** Hiding modeline (hide mode line mode)

Hiding the mode line isn't something I use in most major modes. However, I found it complements my shell ([[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/complete-guide-mastering-eshell][eshell]]) quite well. While I was sceptical at first, once I hid the mode line in my shell I never looked back. I just didn't miss it. I also love the uncluttered clean vibe. [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-hide-mode-line][hide-mode-line-mode]] can help with that.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
[[file:images/my-emacs-eye-candy/eshell.gif]]

** Welcome screen

Back in October 2022, I experimented with [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-a-welcoming-experiment/][adding a minimal welcome screen]]. I was initially hesitant, as I was already a fan of the welcome scratch buffer. In any case, I figured I'd eventually get tired of it and remove it. Well, it's enabled in my config still ;) My initial attachment to a landing scratch quickly faded. I'm only a =C-x b= binding away from invoking ivy-switch-buffer to get me anywhere.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80%

** Zones

I've been meaning to re-enable [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/play/zone.el][zones]] in my config. They always gave me a good tickle. I've already mentioned [[https://depp.brause.cc/zone-nyan/][zone-nyan]], but if you're new to zones, they kick off after a period of inactivity (similar to a screensaver).

* [2023-04-08 Sat] shell-maker, a maker of Emacs shells
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: a-shell-maker
:END:
A few weeks ago, I wrote about an experiment to bring [[https://xenodium.com/a-chatgpt-emacs-shell/][ChatGPT to Emacs as a shell]]. I was fairly new to both [[https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt][ChatGPT]] and building anything on top of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shell-Prompts.html][comint]]. It was a fun exercise, which also generated some interest.

As mentioned in the previous post, I took inspiration in other Emacs packages (primarily [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Lisp-Interaction.html][ielm]]) to figure out what I needed from comint. Soon, I got ChatGPT working.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80%
[[file:images/a-shell-maker/streamer.gif]]

As I was looking at [[https://openai.com][OpenAI]] API docs, I learned about DALL-E: "an AI system that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language."

Like ChatGPT, they also offered an API to DALL-E, so I figured I may as well try to write a shell for that too... and I did.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%
[[file:images/a-shell-maker/dalle.gif]]

There was quite a bit of code duplication between the two Emacs shells I had just written. At the same time, I started hearing from folks about integrating other tools, some cloud-based, some local, proprietary, open source.. There's [[https://about.sourcegraph.com/cody][Cody]], [[https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI][invoke-ai]],  [[https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp][llama.cpp]], [[https://github.com/antimatter15/alpaca.cpp][alpaca.cpp]], and the list continues to grow.

With that in mind, I set out to reduce the code duplication and consolidate into a reusable package. And so =shell-maker= was born, a maker of Emacs shells.

=shell-maker='s internals aren't too different from the code I had before. It's still powered by comint, but instead offers a reusable convenience wrapper.

It takes little code to implement a shell, like the sophisticated new =greeter-shell= ;)

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%
[[file:images/a-shell-maker/maria.gif]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'shell-maker)

  (defvar greeter-shell--config
    (make-shell-maker-config
     :name "Greeter"
     :execute-command
     (lambda (command _history callback error-callback)
       (funcall callback
                (format "Hello \"%s\"" command)
                nil))))

  (defun greeter-shell ()
    "Start a Greeter shell."
    (interactive)
    (shell-maker-start greeter-shell--config))
#+end_src

[[https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell#shell-maker][shell-maker]] is available on GitHub and currently bundled with [[https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell][chatgpt-shell]]. If there's enough interest and usage, I may just break it out into its own package. For now, it's convenient to keep with =chatgpt-shell= and =dall-e-shell=.

If you plug =shell-maker= into other tools, I'd love to hear about it.

Happy shell making!

* [2023-03-21 Tue] A ChatGPT Emacs shell
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: a-chatgpt-emacs-shell
:END:
UPDATE: =chatgpt-shell= [[https://xenodium.com/chatgpt-shell-available-on-melpa/][has evolved a bit]] and is now [[https://melpa.org/#/chatgpt-shell][on MELPA]].

I had been meaning to give [[https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt][ChatGPT]] a good try, preferably from Emacs. As an [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html][eshell]] fan, ChatGPT seemed like the perfect fit for a shell interface of sorts. With that in mind, I set out to wire ChatGPT with Emacs's general command interpreter ([[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shell-Prompts.html][comint]]).

I had no previous experience building anything comint-related, so I figured I could just take a peek at an existing comint-derived mode to achieve a similar purpose. =inferior-emacs-lisp-mode= ([[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Lisp-Interaction.html][ielm]]) seemed to fit the bill just fine, so I borrowed quite a bit to assemble a basic shell experience.

From then on, it was mostly about sending each request over to the ChatGPT API to get a response. For now, I'm relying on [[https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html][curl]] to make each request. The invocation is fairly straightforward:

#+begin_src sh
  curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions" \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_KEY" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d "{
       \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",
       \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"YOUR PROMPT\"}]
       }"
#+end_src

There are two bits of information needed in each request. The API key, which you must get from [[https://openai.com/][OpenAI]], and the prompt text itself (i.e. whatever you want ChatGPT to help you with). The results are not too shabby.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80%
[[file:images/a-chatgpt-emacs-shell/chatgpt.gif]]

I've uploaded the code to GitHub as a tiny [[https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell][chatgpt-shell]] package. It's a little experimental and rough still, but hey, it does the job for now. Head over to [[https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell][github]] to take a look. The latest iteration handles multiline prompts (use C-j for newlines) and basic code highlighting.

** Dice the chicken
- 350 grams boneless chicken thighs

Dice the chicken up.

** Marinade for 30 mins

- 1 tablespoon soy sauce (Kikkoman or similar)
- 1 tablespoon cooking Sake
- 2 tablespoons of grated ginger (include liquids)
- 1/2 teaspoon Mirin

Mix all ingredients into a ziploc bag. Add the diced chicken and let it marinade for 30 minutes in the fridge.

** Pat dry

- Paper towels

After marinating, pat the chicken dry with paper towels and set aside.

** Breading

- Potato starch

Ok, not quite breading since we're using potato starch but same goal. Sprinkle the chicken pieces and make sure they are fully coated with the starch.

** Frying (1st round)

- Vegetable oil
- Paper towels

Heat up (roughly at 160°C) enough oil in a pan to cover the chicken pieces. Cook for about 3 minutes. The pieces don't have to be super golden at this point. There will be another round of frying for that.

** Rest for 4 minutes

- Paper towels

Let the chicken rest on paper towels for about 4 minutes before frying again.

** Frying (2nd round)

- Vegetable oil
- Paper towels

This time heat up the oil at roughly 200°C. This is a quick in-and-out action to make the chicken crispy. Cook for 30 seconds. Take out and set aside on some paper towels. Let it cool and it's ready to eat.

** Dipping

- Kewpie mayo
- Sriracha sauce

This is totally optional, but I'm a fan of both Kewpie mayo and Sriracha sauce. You can dip your chicken in either or both!

* [2023-01-10 Tue] Emacs: org-present in style
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: emacs-org-present-in-style
:END:
I had been meaning to check out David Wilson's [[https://systemcrafters.cc][System Crafters]] post detailing [[https://systemcrafters.net/emacs-tips/presentations-with-org-present/][his presentations style]] achieved with the help of [[https://github.com/rlister/org-present][org-present]] and his own customizations. If you're looking for ways to present from Emacs itself, David's post is well worth a look.

org-present's spartan but effective approach resonated with me. David's touches bring the wonderfully stylish icing to the cake. I personally liked his practice of collapsing slide subheadings by default. This lead me to think about slide navigation in general...

There were two things I wanted to achieve:

1. Easily jump between areas of interest. Subheadings, links, and code blocks would be a good start.
2. Collapse all but the current top-level heading within the slide, as navigation focus changes.

A quick search for existing functions led me to =org-next-visible-heading=, =org-next-link=, and =org-next-block=. While these make it easy to jump through jump between headings, links, org block on their own, I wanted to jump to whichever one of these is next (similar a web browser's tab behaviour). In a way, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM][DWIM]] style.

I wrapped the existing functions to enable returning positions. This gave me =ar/rg-next-visible-heading-pos=, =ar/rg-next-link-pos=, and =ar/rg-next-block-pos= respectively. Now that I can find out the next location of either of these items, I can subsequently glue the navigation logic in a function like =ar/org-present-next-item=. To restore balance to the galaxy, I also added =ar/org-present-previous-item=.

Beware, this was a minimal effort (with redundant code, duplication, etc) and should likely be considered a proof of concept of sorts, but the results look promising. You can see a demo in action.

While this was a fun exercise, I can't help but think there must be a cleaner way of doing it or there are existing packages that already do this for you. If you do know, I'd love to know.

Future versions of this code will likely be updated in [[https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/features/fe-org.el][my Emacs org config]].

** Update

Removed a bunch of duplication and now rely primarily on existing =org-next-visible-heading=, =org-next-link=, and =org-next-block=.

* [2023-01-08 Sun] Emacs: insert and render SF symbols
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: emacs-insert-and-render-sf-symbols
:END:
About a week ago, I added an Emacs [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-macro-me-some-sf-symbols/][function to insert SF symbol names]]. This is specially useful for SwiftUI. I didn't bother too much with inserting symbols themselves since I hadn't figured out a way to render them for all buffers. That's now changed.

Christian Tietze and Alan Third both have useful posts in this space:

- [[http://idiocy.org/emacs-fonts-and-fontsets.html][Emacs, fonts and fontsets]]
- [[https://christiantietze.de/posts/2023/01/use-sf-pro-for-sf-symbols-everywhere-in-emacs/][Use San Francisco Font for SF Symbols Everywhere in Emacs]]

I'm currently using the following to render SF symbols in all buffers (macOS only):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  ;; Enable rendering SF symbols on macOS.
  (when (memq system-type '(darwin))
    (set-fontset-font t nil "SF Pro Display" nil 'append))
#+end_src

Now that I can render SF symbols everywhere, I /may/ be more included to use them to spif things up.

I've added =sf-symbol-insert= to [[https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/ar/sf.el][sf.el]], let's see if usage sticks.

* [2022-12-31 Sat] Emacs: Macro me some SF Symbols
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: emacs-macro-me-some-sf-symbols
:END:
For inserting SF Symbols in SwiftUI, I typically rely on Apple's [[https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/][SF Symbols app]] to browse the symbols's catalog. Once I find a symbol I'm happy with, I copy its name and paste it into my Swift source. This works fairly well.

With Christian Tietze recently posting [[https://christiantietze.de/posts/2022/12/sf-symbols-emacs-tab-numbers/][how he rendered SF Symbols in Emacs]], I figured there may be a way to shift the above workflow to rely on Emacs completion instead. While I initially went down a rabbit hole to programmatically extract SF symbols (via something like [[https://github.com/SFSafeSymbols/SFSafeSymbols][SFSafeSymbols]]), I took a step back to rethink the strategy.

From the [[https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/][SF Symbols app]], one can select multiple symbols and copy/paste either the symbols themselves or their respective names. The catch is you can only copy disjointed data. That is, you can copy the symbols or their names, but not both in one go. Let's take a look at what the disjointed data looks like. I've pasted both under separate sections in an Emacs buffer.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 60% :height 60%
[[file:images/emacs-macro-me-some-sf-symbols/disjointed.png]]


If I could rejoin these two sets, I would have a lookup table I could easily invoke from Emacs.

There are roughly 4500 symbols, so copying, pasting, along with text manipulation isn't manually feasible. Lucky for us, an Emacs [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Keyboard-Macros.html][keyboard macro]] is the perfect hammer for this nail. You can see the macro in action below.

This looks fairly magical (and it is), but when you break it down into its building blocks, it's nothing more than recording your keystrokes and replaying them. Starting with the cursor at the beginning of =square.and.arrow.up=, these are the keystrokes we'd need to record:

- C-s :: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Basic-Isearch.html][iseach-forward]] to search for a character and jump to it
- = :: insert === so we jump to == Symbols ==
- <return> :: runs [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Basic-Isearch.html][isearch-exit]] since we're done jumping.
- C-n :: =next-line=.
- C-a :: =beginning-of-line=.
- C-SPC :: =set-mark-command= to activate the region.
- C-f :: =forward-char= to select symbol.
- C-w :: =kill-ring-save= to cut/kill the symbol.
- C-u C-<space> :: =set-mark-command= (with prefix) to jump back to where we started before searching.
- C-y :: =yank= to yank/paste the symbol.
- C-<space> :: =set-mark-command= to activate the region.
- C-e :: =end-of-line= to select the entire line.
- " :: As a [[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens][smartparens]] user, inserting quote with region places quotes around selection.
- C-n :: =next-line=.
- C-a :: =beginning-of-line=. We are now at a strategic location where we can replay the above commands.

To start/end recording and executing keyboard macros, use:

- C-x ( :: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Basic-Keyboard-Macro.html][kmacro-start-macro]]
- C-x ) :: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Basic-Keyboard-Macro.html][kmacro-end-macro]]
- C-x e :: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Basic-Keyboard-Macro.html][kmacro-end-and-call-macro]] runs your macro. Press =e= immediately after to execute again.
- C-u 0 C-x e :: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Basic-Keyboard-Macro.html][kmacro-end-and-call-macro]] (with zero prefix) repeat until there is an error.

Our previous example ran on a handful of SF symbols. Let's bring out the big guns and run on the entire dataset. This time, we'll run the entire flow, including macro creation and executing until there is an error (i.e. process the whole lot).

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 90% :height 90%

Now that we have our data joined, we can feed it to the humble [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Completion.html][completing-read]].

[[file:images/emacs-macro-me-some-sf-symbols/sf-symbols-insert-name.png]]

It's worth highlighting that to render SF Symbols in Emacs, we must [[https://christiantietze.de/posts/2022/12/sf-symbols-emacs-tab-numbers/][propertize our text with one of the macOS SF fonts]], for example "SF Pro".

With all the pieces in place, let's use our new function to insert SF symbol names in a SwiftUI snippet. Since we're using =completing-read= we can fuzzy search our lookups with our favorite completion frameworks (in my case via [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]]).

While this post is macOS-specific, it gives a taste of how powerful Emacs [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Keyboard-Macros.html][keyboard macros]] can be. Be sure to check out [[https://emacsrocks.com/e05.html][Emacs Rocks!

For those that dabble in elisp, you can appreciate how handy  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Completion.html][completing-read]] is with very little code.

The full source to [[https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/ar/sf.el][sf-symbol-insert-name]] is available in my [[https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/][Emacs config repo]]. The function is fairly bare bones and has had fairly little testing. Patches totally welcome.

** Update
There is some redundancy in the snippet I had forgotten to remove. Either way, latest version at [[https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/ar/sf.el][sf.el]].

* [2022-12-18 Sun] Emacs: ffmpeg and macOS aliasing commands
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: emacs-ffmpeg-and-macos-alias-commands
:END:
On a recent mastodon [[https://twit.social/@chris_spackman/109531700714365786][post]], Chris Spackman mentioned he uses Emacs to save [[https://ffmpeg.org/][ffmpeg]] commands he's figured out for later usage. Emacs is great for this kind of thing. I've tried different approaches over time and eventually landed on [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]], a small package I wrote. Like Chris, I also wanted a way to invoke magical incantations of known shell commands without having to remember all the details.

Chris's post reminded me of a few use-cases I'd been meaning to add DWIM shell commands for.

*** ffmpeg

1. Trimming seconds from videos
   - =dwim-shell-commands-video-trim-beginning= using:
     #+begin_src sh
       ffmpeg -i '<<f>>' -y -ss <<Seconds:5>> -c:v copy -c:a copy '<<fne>>_trimmed.<<e>>'
     #+end_src
   - =dwim-shell-commands-video-trim-end= using:
     #+begin_src sh
       ffmpeg -sseof -<<Seconds:5>> -i '<<f>>' -y -c:v copy -c:a copy '<<fne>>_trimmed.<<e>>'
     #+end_src

     Side-node: The =<<Seconds:5>>= placeholder is recognized as a query, so Emacs will prompt you for a numeric value.
2. Extracting audio from videos
   - =dwim-shell-commands-video-to-mp3= using:
     #+begin_src sh
       ffmpeg -i '<<f>>' -vn -ab 128k -ar 44100 -y '<<fne>>.mp3'
     #+end_src

With these new dwim shell commands added, I can easily apply them one after the other. No need to remember command details.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 60% :height 60%
[[file:images/emacs-ffmpeg-and-macos-alias-commands/trim_convert_mp3_x1.4.webp]]

*** macOS aliases

After rebuilding Emacs via the wonderful [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][emacs-plus]], I recently broke my existing =/Applications/Emacs.app= alias. No biggie, one can easily add a [[https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp1046/mac][new one alias from macOS Finder]], but I've been wanting to do it from Emacs. Turns out there's a bit of AppleScript we can turn into a more memorale command like =dwim-shell-commands-macos-make-finder-alias=:

#+begin_src sh
  osascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to make alias file to POSIX file \"<<f>>\" at POSIX file \"%s\"'
#+end_src

It's highly unlikely I'll remember the AppleScript snippet (are there better ways?), but I'll easily find and invoke my new command with fuzzy searching:

* [2022-12-12 Mon] Emacs: Context-aware yasnippets
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: emacs-generate-a-swift-initializer
:END:
Back in 2020, I wrote a semi-automatic [[https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet][yasnippet]] to [[https://xenodium.com/smarter-snippets/][generate Swift initializers]]. I say semi-automatic because it could have been a little smarter. While it helped generate some of the code, what I really wanted was full context-aware generation. The Swift struct already had a few properties defined, so a smarter yasnippet should have been able to use this info for code generation.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 60% :height 60%
[[file:images/smarter-snippets/snippet.gif]]

With an extra push, we could have written a smarter yasnippet, but it may require a fair bit of parsing logic. Fast forward to today, and bringing context-awareness seems like the right match for [[https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/][Tree-sitter]]. While Tree-sitter can enable faster and more reliable syntax-highlighting in our beloved text editor, it can also power smarter tools. It does so by exposing a semantic snapshot of our source code using a syntax tree.

Let's see how we can use Tree-sitter to realise our original yasnippet vision. We'll start with the same struct snippet we used back in 2020. The goal is to generate an initializer using the existing definitions.

#+begin_src swift
  struct Coordinate {
    public let x: Int
    public let y: Int
    public let z: Int
  }
#+end_src

While Emacs will [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2022-11/msg01443.html][will soon ship its own Tree-sitter integration]], I've opted to try out the [[https://github.com/emacs-tree-sitter/elisp-tree-sitter][emacs-tree-sitter]] package as Swift support is currently included in [[https://github.com/emacs-tree-sitter/tree-sitter-langs][tree-sitter-langs]].

I have much to learn much about Tree-sitter syntax trees, but the package ships with a handy tool to dump the tree via =tree-sitter-debug-mode=.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 90% :height 90%
[[file:images/emacs-generate-a-swift-initializer/syntax-tree.png]]

With a syntax tree in mind, one can craft a query to semantically extract parts of the code. In our case, we want property names and types.
I've yet to get acquainted with Tree-sitter's [[https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/using-parsers#query-syntax][query syntax]], but the package also ships with another handy tool that helps view query results via =tree-sitter-query-builder=.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 90% :height 90%
[[file:images/emacs-generate-a-swift-initializer/query-builder.png]]

The following query extracts all the =let properties= in file. You can see the builder in action above, highlighting our query results.

#+begin_src
  (struct_declaration (constant_declaration (identifier) @name (type) @value))
#+end_src

If we want to be more thorough, we should likely cater for classes, vars, int/string literals, etc. so the query needs to be extended as follows. I'm sure it can be written differently, but for now, it does the job.

#+begin_src
  (struct_declaration (variable_declaration (identifier) @name (type) @type))
  (struct_declaration (variable_declaration (identifier) @name (string) @value))
  (struct_declaration (variable_declaration (identifier) @name (number) @value))
  (struct_declaration (constant_declaration (identifier) @name (type) @value))
  (struct_declaration (constant_declaration (identifier) @name (string) @value))
  (struct_declaration (constant_declaration (identifier) @name (number) @value))
  (class_declaration (variable_declaration (identifier) @name (type) @type))
  (class_declaration (variable_declaration (identifier) @name (string) @value))
  (class_declaration (variable_declaration (identifier) @name (number) @value))
  (class_declaration (constant_declaration (identifier) @name (type) @type))
  (class_declaration (constant_declaration (identifier) @name (string) @value))
  (class_declaration (constant_declaration (identifier) @name (number) @value))
#+end_src

Now that we got our Tree-sitter query sorted, let's write a little elisp to extract the info we need from the generated tree. We'll write a =swift-class-or-struct-vars-at-point= function to extract the struct (or class) at point and subsequently filter its property names/types using our query. To simplify the result, we'll return a list of alists.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no

#+end_src

We're so close now. All we need is a simple way invoke our code generator. We can use yasnippet for that, making =init= our expandable keyword.

  # name: init all
  # key: init
  # --
  `(swift-class-or-struct-initializer-text (swift-class-or-struct-vars-at-point))`

* [2022-11-13 Sun] Emacs: quickly killing processes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: emacs-quick-kill-process
:END:
Every so often, I need to kill the odd unresponsive process. While I really like =proced= (check out Mickey Petersen's [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/displaying-interacting-processes-proced][article]]), I somehow find myself using macOS's [[https://support.apple.com/en-bw/guide/activity-monitor/actmaea30277/mac][Activity Monitor]] to this purpose. Kinda odd, considering I prefer to do these kinds of things from Emacs.

What I'd really like is a way to quickly fuzzy search a list of active processes and choose the unresponsive culprid, using my preferred completion frontend (in my case [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]]).

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 95% :height 95%
[[file:images/emacs-quick-kill-process/kill_x1.8.webp]]

The function below gives us a fuzzy-searchable process utility. While we could use =ivy-read= directly in our implementation, we're better of using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Completion.html][completing-read]] to remain compatible with other completion frameworks. I'm a big fan of the humble =completing-read=. You feed it a list of candidates and it prompts users to pick one.

To build our process list, we can lean on =proced='s own source: =proced-process-attributes=. We transform its output to an [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Association-Lists.html][alist]], formatting the visible keys to contain the process id, owner, command name, and the command line which invoked the process. Once a process is chosen, we can send a kill signal using  +signal-process+ [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]] and our /job is done/.

** Update

I've moved =dwim-shell-commands-kill-process= from my Emacs [[https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies][config]] to [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-commands.el][dwim-shell-commands.el]]. A few advantages:

- Killing processes is now async.
- Should anything go wrong, an error message is now accessible.
- You can easily install via [[https://melpa.org/#/dwim-shell-command][MELPA]].

* [2022-11-06 Sun] Hey Emacs, change the default macOS app for...
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: hey-emacs-change-the-default-macos-app-for
:END:
A few weeks ago, I [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-open-with-macos-app/][added an "open with"]] command to [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-commands.el][dwim-shell-commands.el]]. It's pretty handy for opening files using an external app (ie. not Emacs) other than the default macOS one.

=dwim-shell-commands-macos-open-with= and =dwim-shell-commands-open-externally= are typically enough for me to handle opening files outside of Emacs. But every now and then I'd like to change the default macOS app associated with specific file types. Now this isn't particularly challenging in macOS, but it does require a little navigating to get to the right place to change this default setting.

Back in March 2020, I [[https://twitter.com/xenodium/status/1242879439932923909][tweeted]] about [[https://github.com/moretension/duti][duti]]: a command-line utility capable of setting default applications for various document types on macOS. While I liked the ability to change default apps from the command-line, the habit never quite stuck.

Fast forward to 2022. I've been revisiting lots of my command-line usages (specially those that never stuck) and making them more accessible from Emacs via [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]]. I seldom change default apps on macOS, so my brain forgets about =duti= itself, let alone its arguments, order, etc. But with a dwim shell command like =dwim-shell-commands-macos-set-default-app=, I can easily invoke the command via [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][swiper]]'s =counsel-M-x= fuzzy terms: /"dwim set"/.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 95% :height 95%
[[file:images/hey-emacs-change-the-default-macos-app-for/set-default_x1.3.webp]]

As an added bonus, I get to reuse =dwim-shell-commands--macos-apps= from "open with" to quickly pick the new default app, making the whole experience pretty snappy.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun dwim-shell-commands-macos-set-default-app ()

* [2022-11-02 Wed] Hey Emacs, where did I take that photo?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: hey-emacs-where-did-i-take-that-photo
:END:
I was recently browsing through an old archive of holiday photos (from [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]] of course). I wanted to know where the photo was taken, which got me interested in extracting [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif][Exif]] metadata.

Luckily the [[https://exiftool.org/][exiftool]] command line utility does the heavy lifting when it comes to extracting metadata. Since I want it quickly accessible from Emacs (in either dired or current buffer), a tiny elisp snippet would give me just that (via [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]]).

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 95% :height 95%

     "View EXIF"
     "exiftool '<<f>>'"
     :utils "exiftool"))
#+end_src

The above makes all Exif metadata easily accessible, including the photo's GPS coordinates. But I haven’t quite answered the original question. Where did I take the photo? I now know the coordinates, but I can’t realistically deduce neither the country nor city unless I /manually/ feed these values to a reverse geocoding service like [[https://www.openstreetmap.org/][OpenStreetMap]]. /Manually/ you say? This is Emacs, so we can throw more elisp glue at the problem, mixed in with a little shell script, and presto! We've now automated the process of extracting metadata, reverse geocoding, and displaying the photo's address in the minibuffer. Pretty nifty.

           (while (re-search-forward "^json_start\\(.*?\\)json_end" nil t)
             (push (match-string 1) matches))
           (message "%s" (string-join (seq-map (lambda (json)

                                      "\n")))
         (kill-buffer buffer)))))
#+end_src

Displaying the photo's address in the minibuffer is indeed pretty nifty, but what if I’d like to drop a pin in a map for further exploration? This is actually simpler, as there's no need for reverse geocoding. Following a similar recipe, we merely construct an [[https://www.openstreetmap.org/][OpenStreetMap]] URL and open it in our favourite browser.

The =*scratch*= buffer is the first thing I see when I launch an Emacs session. Coupled with [[https://github.com/Fanael/persistent-scratch][persistent-scratch]], it's served me well over the years. I gotta say though, my scratch buffer accumulates random bits and often becomes a little messy. It's not the most visually appealing landing buffer when launching Emacs. But who cares, I'm only a =C-x b= binding away from invoking =ivy-switch-buffer= to get me wherever I need to be. It's powered by =ivy-use-virtual-buffers=, which remembers recent files across sessions.

Having said all of this, I recently ran into u/pearcidar43's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/yamj5f/exwm_emacs_is_kinda_comfy_as_a_wm/][post]] showcasing a wonderful Emacs banner.

Nothing fancy, the only requirements being to load quickly and enable me to get on with my =C-x b= ritual. Throw in a little bonus to exit quickly by pressing just =q= if I so desire.

[[file:images/emacs-a-welcoming-experiment/welcome-minimal_x0.5.webp]]

I didn't know a whole lot on how to go about it, so I took a peak at [[https://github.com/emacs-dashboard/emacs-dashboard][emacs-dashboard]] for inspiration. Turns out, I needed little code to get
the desired effect in my =early-init.el=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun ar/show-welcome-buffer ()
    "Show *Welcome* buffer."
    (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create "*Welcome*")
      (setq truncate-lines t)
      (let* ((buffer-read-only)
             (image-path "~/.emacs.d/emacs.png")
             (image (create-image image-path))
             (size (image-size image))
             (height (cdr size))
             (width (car size))
             (top-margin (floor (/ (- (window-height) height) 2)))
             (left-margin (floor (/ (- (window-width) width) 2)))
             (prompt-title "Welcome to Emacs!"))
        (erase-buffer)
        (setq mode-line-format nil)
        (goto-char (point-min))
        (insert (make-string top-margin ?\n ))
        (insert (make-string left-margin ?\ ))
        (insert-image image)
        (insert "\n\n\n")
        (insert (make-string (floor (/ (- (window-width) (string-width prompt-title)) 2)) ?\ ))
        (insert prompt-title))
      (setq cursor-type nil)
      (read-only-mode +1)
      (switch-to-buffer (current-buffer))
      (local-set-key (kbd "q") 'kill-this-buffer)))

  (setq initial-scratch-message nil)
  (setq inhibit-startup-screen t)

  (when (< (length command-line-args) 2)
    (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook (lambda ()
                                    (when (display-graphic-p)

#+end_src

This being Emacs, I can bend it as far as needed. In my case, I didn't need much, so I can probably stop here. It was a fun experiment. I'll even [[https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/commit/90c689def913a9bccdd408ef609c7f99a5cce1fb][try using it]] for a little while and see if it sticks. I'm sure there's plenty more that could be handled (edge cases, resizes, etc.), but if you want something more established, consider something like [[https://github.com/emacs-dashboard/emacs-dashboard][emacs-dashboard]] instead. I haven't used it myself, but is [[https://melpa.org/#/dashboard][pretty popular]].

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: emacs-open-with-macos-app
:END:
On a recent Reddit [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/y2dfma/comment/is4ygl8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][comment]], tdstoff7 asked if I had considered writing an "Open with" DWIM shell command for those times one would like to open a file externally using an app other than the default. I hadn't, but nice idea.

Take images as an example. Though Emacs can display them quickly, I also open images externally using the default app ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preview_(macOS)][Preview]] in my case). But then there are those times when I'd like to open with a different app for editing (maybe something like GIMP). It'd be nice to quickly choose which app to open with.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80% :height 80%
[[file:images/emacs-open-with-macos-app/open-with_x2.webp]]

There isn't much to the code. Get a list of apps, ask user to pick one (via [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Programmed-Completion.html][completing-read]]), and launch the external app via =dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files=.

There's likely a better way of getting a list of available apps (happy to take suggestions), but searching in "/Applications" "~/Applications" and "/System/Applications" does the job for now.

A quick follow-up to [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-macos-share-from-dired-dwim-style/][Emacs: macOS sharing (DWIM style)]]... Though functional, the implementation had a couple of drawbacks.

Tohiko [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/y1tneh/comment/is0pgkf][noticed fullscreen wasn't working at all]] while Calvin [[https://lobste.rs/s/qga1px/emacs_macos_sharing_dwim_style#c_safiuw][proposed enumeration for tighter Emacs integration]].

Calvin's suggestion enables using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Completion.html][completing-read]] to pick the sharing service. This makes the integration feel more at home. As a bonus, it also enables sharing from fullscreen Emacs.

As an [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]] user, you can see a vertical list of sharing services.

UPDATE: See an improved implementation [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-macos-sharing-dwim-style-improved][here]].

A few days ago, [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-reveal-in-finder-dwim-style/][I wrote dwim-shell-commands-macos-reveal-in-finder]]. While I've written a bunch of other [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-commands.el][dwim-shell-commands]], what set this case apart was the use of [[https://www.swift.org/][Swift]] to glue an Emacs workflow.

There is hardly any Swift involved, yet it scratched a real itch I couldn't otherwise reach (reveal multiple dired files in macOS's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finder_(software)][Finder]]).

divinedominion's [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/xzt3gx/comment/irrwoya/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][reddit comment]] got me thinking of other use-cases, so I figured why not push this Swift-elisp beeswax a little further... Let's add macOS's sharing ability via [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]], so I could invoke it from the comfort of my beloved [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]] or any 'ol Emacs buffer visiting a file.

:END:
Just the other day, [[https://github.com/gvoysey][Graham Voysey]] filed an [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/issues/3][escaping bug]] against [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]]. Once he verified the the fix, he also posted [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/issues/3#issuecomment-1272413459][two uses]] of =dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files=. I've made some small tweaks, but here's the gist of it:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun dwim-shell-commands-feh-marked-files ()
    "View all marked files with feh."
    (interactive)
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "View with feh"
     "feh --auto-zoom --scale-down '<<*>>'"
     :silent-success t
     :utils "feh"))

  (defun dwim-shell-commands-dragon-marked-files ()
    "Share all marked files with dragon."
    (interactive)
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "View with dragon"
     "dragon --on-top '<<*>>'"
     :silent-success t
     :utils "dragon"))
#+end_src

I love seeing what others get up to by using =dwim-shell-command=. Are there new magical command-line utilities out there I don't know about? In this instance, I got to learn about [[https://feh.finalrewind.org/][feh]] and [[https://github.com/mwh/dragon][dragon]].

[[https://feh.finalrewind.org/][feh]] is a no-frills image viewer for console users while [[https://github.com/mwh/dragon][dragon]] is a simple drag-and-drop source/sink for X or Wayland. Both utilities are great uses of =dwim-shell-command=, enabling a seamless transition from Emacs to the /outside world/. These days I'm rarely on a linux box, so I was keen to ensure macOS had these cases covered.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preview_(macOS)][Preview]] is a solid macOS equivalent to [[https://feh.finalrewind.org/][feh]]. =Preview= is already macOS's default image viewer. A simple =open '<<f>>'= would do the job, but if we'd like to make this command more portable, we can accomodate as follows:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun dwim-shell-commands-open-externally ()
    "Open file(s) externally."
    (interactive)
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "Open externally"
     (if (eq system-type 'darwin)
         "open '<<f>>'"
       "xdg-open '<<f>>'")
     :silent-success t
     :utils "open"))
#+end_src

Special mention goes to Bozhidar Batsov's [[https://github.com/bbatsov/crux][crux]] which achieves similar functionality via =crux-open-with=. [[https://github.com/bbatsov/crux][crux]] provides a bunch of other useful functions. Some of my favourites being =crux-duplicate-current-line-or-region=, =crux-transpose-windows=, =crux-delete-file-and-buffer=, and =crux-rename-buffer-and-file=, but I digress.

Moving on to a [[https://github.com/mwh/dragon][dragon]] equivalent on macOS, I thought I had it covered via [[https://github.com/kaz-yos/reveal-in-osx-finder][reveal-in-osx-finder]] or [[https://github.com/jcs-elpa/reveal-in-folder][reveal-in-folder]]. Turns out, neither of these reveal multiple [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]]-selected files within [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finder_(software)][Finder]]. At first, I thought this could be easily achieved by passing additional flags/params to macOS's =open= command, but it doesn't seem to be the case. Having said that, this [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7652928/launch-finder-window-with-specific-files-selected][Stack Overflow post]], has a solution in Objective-C, which is where things got a little more interesting. You see, back in July I [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-dwim-shell-command-multi-language/][added multi-language support]] to [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-dwim-shell-command-multi-language/][dwim-shell-command]] and while it highlighted language flexibility, I hadn't yet taken advantage of this feature myself. That is, until today.

The Objective-C snippet from the Stack Overflow post can be written as a Swift one-liner. Ok I lie. It's actually two lines, counting the import, but you can see that this multi-language Emacs transition/integration is pretty easy to add.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun dwim-shell-commands-macos-reveal-in-finder ()
    "Reveal selected files in macOS Finder."

     :join-separator ", "
     :silent-success t
     :shell-pipe "swift -"))
#+end_src

:END:
[[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]] is a little Emacs package I wrote to enable crafting more reusable shell commands. I intended to use it as an [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shell.html][async-shell-command]] alternative (and I do these days). The more surprising win was bringing lots of command-line utilities (sometimes with complicated invocations) and making them quickly accessible. I no longer need to remember their respective parameters, order, flags, etc.

I've migrated most [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-password-protect-current-pdf-revisited/][one-liners]] and [[https://xenodium.com/png-to-icns-emacs-dwim-style/][scripts]] I had to [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]] equivalents. They are available at [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-commands.el][dwim-shell-commands.el]]. Having said that, it's great to discover new usages from =dwim-shell-command= users.

Take [[https://www.reddit.com/user/TiMueller/][u/TiMueller]]'s Reddit comment, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w8s2ov/comment/iq7idav/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][showcasing pdftotext]]. Neat utility I was unaware of. It does as it says on the tin and converts a pdf to text. Can be easily saved to your accessible repertoire with:

Though this use-case is already covered by Tramp, I suspect a DWIM command would make it a little more convenient (async by default). However, Tramp paths aren't usable from the shell unless we massage them a little. We can use =dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files='s =:post-process-template= to drop the "/ssh:" prefix.

* [2022-08-18 Thu] dwim-shell-command with template prompts
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: dwim-shell-command-with-template-prompts
:END:
Somewhat recently, I wanted to quickly create an empty/transparent png file. [[https://imagemagick.org/][ImageMagick]]'s convert has you covered here. Say you want a transparent 200x400 image, you can get it with:

#+begin_src sh
  convert -verbose -size 200x400 xc:none empty200x400.png
#+end_src

Great, I now know the one-liner for it. But because I'm in the mood of saving these as [[https://xenodium.com/seamless-command-line-utils/][seamless command-line utils]], I figured I should save the
[[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]] equivalent.

I wanted configurable image dimensions, so I used [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/calc/Formatting-Lisp-Functions.html][read-number]] together with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Formatting-Strings.html][format]] to create the templated command and fed it to =dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files=. Job done:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun dwim-shell-commands-make-transparent-png ()
    "Create a transparent png."
    (interactive)
    (let ((width (read-number "Width: " 200))
          (height (read-number "Height: " 200)))
      (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
       "Create transparent png"
       (format "convert -verbose -size %dx%d xc:none '<<empty%dx%d.png(u)>>'"
               width height width height)
       :utils "convert")))
#+end_src

The resulting =dwim-shell-commands-make-transparent-png= is fairly simple, but [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]] aims to remove friction so you're more inclined to save reusable commands. In this case, we can shift querying and formatting into the template.

=<<Width:200>>= can be interpreted as "ask the user for a value using the suggested prompt and default value."

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/dwim-shell-command-with-template-prompts/query.png]]

With template queries in mind, =dwim-shell-commands-make-transparent-png= can be further reduced to essentially the interactive command boilerplate and the template itself:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun dwim-shell-commands-make-transparent-png ()
    "Create a transparent png."
    (interactive)
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "Create transparent png"
     "convert -verbose -size <<Width:200>>x<<Height:200>> xc:none '<<empty<<Width:200>>x<<Height:200>>.png(u)>>'"
     :utils "convert"))
#+end_src

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 90% :height 90%
[[file:images/dwim-shell-command-with-template-prompts/empty.webp]]

Note: Any repeated queries (same prompt and default) are treated as equal. That is, ask the user once and replace everywhere. If you'd like to request separate values, change either prompt or the default value.

* [2022-08-14 Sun] Seamless command-line utils
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: seamless-command-line-utils
:END:
Just the other day, I received a restaurant menu split into a handful of image files. I wanted to forward the menu to others but figured I should probably send it as a single file.

ImageMagick's [[https://imagemagick.org/script/convert.php][convert]] command-line utility works great for this purpose. Feed it some images and it creates a pdf for you:

#+begin_src sh
  convert image1.png image2.png image3.png combined.pdf
#+end_src

Using =convert= for this purpose was pretty straightforward. I'm sure I'll use it again in a similar context, but what if I can make future usage more seamless? In the past, I would just make a note of usage and revisit when needed. Though this works well enough, it often requires some amount of manual work (looking things up, tweaking command, etc) if you happen to forget the command syntax.

I wanted common one-liners (or [[https://xenodium.com/png-to-icns-emacs-dwim-style/][longer shell scripts]]) to be easily reusable and accessible from Emacs. Turns out, the [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]] experiment is working fairly well for this purpose. In addition to providing template expansion, it generally [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-dwim-shell-command/][tries to do what I mean]] (focus when needed, reveal new files, rename buffers, etc).

Here's how I saved the =convert= command instance for future usage:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun dwim-shell-commands-join-as-pdf ()
    "Join all marked images as a single pdf."
    (interactive)
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "Join as pdf"
     "convert -verbose '<<*>>' '<<joined.pdf(u)>>'"
     :utils "convert"))
#+end_src

From now on, any time I'd like to join multiple files into a pdf, I can now select them all and invoke =dwim-shell-commands-join-as-pdf=.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 90% :height 90%
[[file:images/seamless-command-line-utils/joined_minimal_x1.2.webp]]

In the saved command, ='<<*>>'= expands to either [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]] selected files or whatever file happens to be open in the current buffer. The buffer file isn't of much help for joining multiple items, but can be handy for other instances (say I want to convert current image to jpeg).

Moving on to ='<<joined.pdf(u)>>'=, we could have just written as =joined.pdf=, but wrapping it ensures the resulting file name is unique. That is, if =joined.pdf= already exists, write =joined(1).pdf= instead.

These kinds of command-line integrations are working well for me. Take the webp animation above, it was created by invoking =dwim-shell-commands-video-to-webp= on a =.mov= file. Easy peasy. While I can easily memorize the =convert= command for the pdf instance, I'm hopeless in the webp scenario:

#+begin_src sh
  ffmpeg -i '<<f>>' -vcodec libwebp -filter:v fps=fps=10 -compression_level 3 -lossless 1 -loop 0 -preset default -an -vsync 0 '<<fne>>'.webp
#+end_src

While searching through command line history helps to quickly re-spin previous commands, it requires remembering the actual utility used for any particular action. On the other hand, wrapping with Emacs functions enables me to remember the action itself, using more memorable names. Also, fuzzy searching works a treat.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70% :height 70%

It's been roughly a month since I started playing around with this idea of wrapping command-line utilities more seamlessly.

On Emacs, /C-x 8 ' a/ would be the equivalent, but it just didn't stick for me. Fortunately, there's an alternative, using dead keys. Mickey Petersen gives a [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/diacritics-in-emacs][wonderful introduction]]. Having said all this, I still longed for macOS's input mechanism.

While it kinda works, "nn" quickly got in the way of my n/p [[https://magit.vc/][magit]] navigation. Perhaps key chords are still an option for someone who doesn't need the "nn" chord, but being a Spanish speaker, I need that "ñ" from long "n" presses!

I'm now trying a little experiment using an =after-change-functions= hook to monitor text input and present the accent menu. I'm sure there's a better way (anyone with ideas?). For now, it gives me something akin to /press-and-hold./

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80% :height 80%

I'm wrapping the hook with a minor mode to easily enable/disable whenever needed. I'm also overriding =accent-diacritics= to only include the characters I typically need.

* [2022-07-28 Thu] dwim-shell-command improvements
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: dwim-shell-command-improvements
:END:
Added a few improvements to [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]].

** Dired region
In DWIM style, if you happen to have a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]] region selected, use region files instead. There's no need to explicitly mark them.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70% :height 70%
[[file:images/dwim-shell-command-improvements/backup_x2.webp]]

** Clipboard (kill-ring) replacement

Use =<<cb>>= to substitute with clipboard content. This is handy for cloning git repos, using a URL copied from your browser.

#+begin_src sh
  git clone <<cb>>
#+end_src

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70% :height 70%
[[file:images/dwim-shell-command-improvements/clone.webp]]

This illustrates =<<cb>>= usage, but you may want to use =dwim-shell-commands-git-clone-clipboard-url= from [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-commands.el][dwim-shell-commands.el]] instead. It does the same thing internally, but makes the command more accessible.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun dwim-shell-commands-git-clone-clipboard-url ()
    "Clone git URL in clipboard to `default-directory'."
    (interactive)
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     (format "Clone %s" (file-name-base (current-kill 0)))
     "git clone <<cb>>"
     :utils "git"))
#+end_src

** Counter replacement

Use =<<n>>= to substitute with a counter. You can also use =<<3n>>= to start the counter at 3.

Handy if you'd like to consistently rename or copy files.

#+begin_src sh
  mv '<<f>>' 'image(<<n>>).png'
#+end_src

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70% :height 70%
[[file:images/dwim-shell-command-improvements/numberedsorted_x2.2.webp]]

Can also use an alphabetic counter with =<<an>>=. Like the numeric version, can use any letter to start the counter with.

#+begin_src sh
mv '<<f>>' 'image(<<an>>).png'
#+end_src

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70% :height 70%
[[file:images/dwim-shell-command-improvements/alphacount_x2.2.webp]]

** Prefix counter

Use a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Prefix-Command-Arguments.html][prefix command argument]] on =dwim-shell-commands= to repeat the command a number of times. Combined with a counter, you can make multiple copies of a single file.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70% :height 70%
[[file:images/dwim-shell-command-improvements/repeat.webp]]

** Optional error prompt

Set =dwim-shell-command-prompt-on-error= to nil to skip error prompts. Focus process buffers automatically instead.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70% :height 70%
[[file:images/dwim-shell-command-improvements/couldnt.png]]

** Configurable prompt

By default, =dwim-shell-command= shows all supported placeholders. You can change that prompt to something shorter using =dwim-shell-command-prompt=.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 90% :height 90%
[[file:images/dwim-shell-command-improvements/prompt.jpg]]

** ⚠️ Use with care ⚠️

The changes are pretty fresh. Please use with caution (specially the counter support).

My pull request to add [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]] to [[https://melpa.org/][melpa]] has been [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa/pull/8129][merged]]. Soon, you'll be able to install [[https://melpa.org/#/dwim-shell-command][directly]] from Milkypostman’s Emacs Lisp Package Archive.

=dwim-shell-command= is another way to invoke shell commands from our beloved editor. Why a different way? It does lots of little things for you, removing friction you didn't realise you had. You can check out the [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][README]], but you'll appreciate it much more once you try it out.

In addition, it's enabled me to bring lots of command-line tools into my Emacs config and make them highly accessible. You can see my usages over at [[https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/ar/dwim-shell-command-commands.el][dwim-shell-command-commands.el]].

What kind of command-line tools? ffmpeg, convert, gifsycle, atool, qdpf, plutil, qrencode, du, sips, iconutil, and git (so far anyway). Below is a simple example, but would love to [[https://twitter.com/xenodium][hear]] how you get to use it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun dwim-shell-command-audio-to-mp3 ()
    "Convert all marked audio to mp3(s)."
    (interactive)
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "Convert to mp3"
     "ffmpeg -stats -n -i '<<f>>' -acodec libmp3lame '<<fne>>.mp3'"
     :utils "ffmpeg"))
#+end_src

* [2022-07-16 Sat] A lifehack for your shell
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: a-lifehack-for-your-shell
:END:
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70% :height 70%
[[file:images/a-lifehack-for-your-shell/unzip_x2.gif]]

I'm a fan of the [[http://infozip.sourceforge.net/mans/unzip.html][unzip]] command line utility that ships with macOS. I give it a .zip file and it unzips it for me. No flags or arguments to remember (for my typical usages anyway). Most importantly, I've fully internalized the =unzip= command into muscle memory, probably because of its /perfect mnemonic/.

But then there's .tar, .tar.gz, .tar.xz, .rar, and a whole world of compression archives, often requiring different tools, flags, etc. and I need to remember those too.

Can't remember where I got this "life hack" from, but it suggests something along the lines of...

#+begin_center
  /Once you find a lost item at home, place it in the first spot you looked./
#+end_center

Great, I'll find things quickly. Win.

Now, I still remember a couple of unarchiving commands from memory (looking at you =tar xvzf=), but I've noticed the first word that pops into mind when extracting is always =unzip=.

There's the great [[https://www.nongnu.org/atool/][atool]] wrapper out there to extract all kinds of archives (would love to hear of others), but unlucky for me, its name never comes to mind as quickly as =unzip= does.

With "life hack" in mind, let's just create an =unzip= [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html][eshell]] alias to =atool=. Next time I need to unarchive anything, the first word that comes to mind (unzip!) will quickly get me on my way...

#+begin_src sh
  alias unzip 'atool --extract --explain $1'
#+end_src

Or if you prefer to add to your Emacs config:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (eshell/alias "unzip" "atool --extract --explain $1")
#+end_src

While [[https://xenodium.com/yasnippet-in-emacs-eshell/][I'm fan of Emacs eshell]], it's not everyone's cup of tea. Lucky for us all, aliases are a popular feature across shells. Happy unzipping!

** Bonus

Since I'm a keen on using "unzip" mnemonic everywhere in Emacs (not just my shell), I now have a [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-dwim-shell-command/][DWIM shell-command]] for it:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun dwim-shell-command-unzip ()
    "Unzip all marked archives (of any kind) using `atool'."
    (interactive)
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "Unzip" "atool --extract --explain '<<f>>'"
     :utils "atool"))
#+end_src

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70% :height 70%

** UPDATE:
[[https://lobste.rs/][Lobste.rs]] has great [[https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell][comments]]. Thanks all:

*** Aliases missing on remote machines

Concerns about aliases [[https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell#c_mqxo73][not available on remote machines]]. Valid. Certainly brings challenges if you can't modify the environment on the remote machine. The severity would depend on how frequently you have to do this. Fortunately for me, it's infrequent.

Additionally, if accessing remote machine via [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html][eshell]], this is a non-issue. You get to transparently bring most of your environment with you anyway.

*** Unzip keyword is overloaded

The alias is [[https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell#c_78nnwt][overloading the unzip command]]. I know. It's a little naughty. Going with it for now. I used to use "extract" (also in comments), which I still like but somehow "unzip" still wins my memory race. [[https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell#c_73bzze][There's also "x"]] (nice option), which seems to originate from [[https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto][prezto]]. I could consider unzipp, unzip1, or some other variation.


Not sure how I missed this, but there's also an [[https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell#c_ra6sbf][existing alias for atool]]: aunpack. Could be a great alternative.


*** Pause before extracting archives

Valid [[https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell#c_73bzze][point]]. In my case, the pause typically happens /before/ I invoke the alias.

*** Littering

If the archive didn't have a root dir, it can [[https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell#c_7fsart][litter your current directory]]. Indeed a pain to clean up. For this, we can atool's =--subdir= param to /always create subdirectory when extracting/.

*** Alias to retrain

[[https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell#c_yr1jby][Neat trick]]: =alias unzip = “echo ‘use atool’”= to help retrain yourself. Reminds me of Emacs [[https://github.com/bbatsov/guru-mode][guru-mode]].

*** atool alternatives

Nice to see other options suggested [[https://github.com/moonpyk/dtrx][dtrx]] ([[https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell#c_mutdjl][comment]]), [[https://github.com/mholt/archiver][archiver]] ([[https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell#c_nlsk7w][comment]]), [[https://github.com/ashang/unar][unar]] ([[https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell#c_90dk1l][comment]]), bsdtar from [[https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive][libarchive]] ([[https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell#c_ojy6ah][comment]]), [[https://packages.debian.org/stable/unp][unp]], [[https://wummel.github.io/patool/][patool]], and the tangentially related [[https://www.nongnu.org/zutils/zutils.html][zgrep]] ([[https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell#c_vp8fdw][comment]]).

As I prune my [[https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/][Emacs config]] off, I came across a forgotten bit of elisp I wrote about 6 years ago. While it's not going to power up your Emacs fu, it may lift your spirits, or maybe just aid discovery of new words.

You see, I had forgotten about [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/play/zone.el][zone.el]] altogether: a fabulous package to tickle your heart. You can think of it as screensaver built into Emacs.

If the built-in zones don't do it for ya, check out the few on melpa ([[https://depp.brause.cc/zone-nyan/][nyan]], [[https://github.com/kawabata/zone-sl][sl]], and [[https://xenodium.com/added-emacs-zone-rainbow/][rainbow]]).

So, my nostalgic bit of elisp dates =Jun 17 2016=: a basic but functional zone ([[https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/ar/zone-words.el][zone-words]]), displaying words from [[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/][WordNet]].

In Emacs time, 2016 is practically yesterday!

I keep on [[https://xenodium.com/png-to-icns-emacs-dwim-style/][goofying around]] with [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]] and it's sibling =dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files= from [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-command.el][dwim-shell-command.el]].

In addition to defaulting to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell][zsh]], =dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files= now support other shells and languages. This comes in handy if you have snippets in different languages and would like to easily invoke them from Emacs. Multi-language support enables "using the best tool for the job" kinda thing. Or maybe you just happen to know how to solve a particular problem in a specific language.

Let's assume you have an existing Python snippet to convert files from csv to json. With =dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files=, you can invoke the Python snippet to operate on either [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]] or buffer files.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun dwim-shell-command-csv-to-json-via-python ()

     "Convert csv file to json (via Python)."
     "
  import csv
  import json
  text = json.dumps({ \"values\": list(csv.reader(open('<<f>>')))})
  fpath = '<<fne>>.json'
  with open(fpath , 'w') as f:
    f.write(text)"
     :shell-util "python"
     :shell-args "-c"))
#+end_src

Or, maybe you prefer Swift and already had a snippet for the same thing?

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun dwim-shell-command-csv-to-json-via-swift ()
    "Convert csv file to json (via Swift)."
    (interactive)
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "Convert csv file to json (via Swift)."
     "
      import Foundation
      import TabularData
      let filePath = \"<<f>>\"
      print(\"reading \\(filePath)\")
      let content = try String(contentsOfFile: filePath).trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)
      let parsedCSV = content.components(separatedBy: CSVWritingOptions().newline).map{
        $0.components(separatedBy: \",\")
      }
      let jsonEncoder = JSONEncoder()
      let jsonData = try jsonEncoder.encode([\"value\": parsedCSV])
      let json = String(data: jsonData, encoding: String.Encoding.utf8)
      let outURL = URL(fileURLWithPath:\"<<fne>>.json\")
      try json!.write(to: outURL, atomically: true, encoding: String.Encoding.utf8)
      print(\"wrote \\(outURL)\")"
     :shell-pipe "swift -"))
#+end_src

You can surely solve the same problem in elisp, but hey it's nice to have options and flexibility.

:END:
UPDATE: [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]] is now available on [[https://melpa.org/#/dwim-shell-command][melpa]].

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70% :height 70%
[[file:images/emacs-password-protect-current-pdf-revisited/passprotect.gif]]

With a recent look at writing [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-dwim-shell-command/][DWIM shell commands]], I've been revisiting my custom Emacs functions invoking command line utilities.

Take this [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-password-protect-current-pdf/][post]], for example, where I invoke [[https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf][qpdf]] via a elisp. Using the new =dwim-shell-command--on-marked-files= in [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-command.el][dwim-shell-command.el]], the code is stripped down to a bare minimum:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun dwim-shell-commands-pdf-password-protect ()
    "Password protect pdf."
    (interactive)
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "Password protect pdf"
     (format "qpdf --verbose --encrypt '%s' '%s' 256 -- '<<f>>' '<<fne>>_enc.<<e>>'"
             (read-passwd "user-password: ")
             (read-passwd "owner-password: "))
     :utils "qpdf"
     :extensions "pdf"))
#+end_src

Compare the above =dwim-shell-command--on-marked-files= usage to my [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-password-protect-current-pdf/][previous implementation]]:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun pdf-password-protect ()
    "Password protect current pdf in buffer or `dired' file."
    (interactive)
    (unless (executable-find "qpdf")
      (user-error "qpdf not installed"))
    (unless (equal "pdf"
                   (or (when (buffer-file-name)
                         (downcase (file-name-extension (buffer-file-name))))
                       (when (dired-get-filename nil t)
                         (downcase (file-name-extension (dired-get-filename nil t))))))
      (user-error "no pdf to act on"))
    (let* ((user-password (read-passwd "user-password: "))
           (owner-password (read-passwd "owner-password: "))
           (input (or (buffer-file-name)
                      (dired-get-filename nil t)))
           (output (concat (file-name-sans-extension input)
                           "_enc.pdf")))
      (message
       (string-trim
        (shell-command-to-string
         (format "qpdf --verbose --encrypt '%s' '%s' 256 -- '%s' '%s'"
                 user-password owner-password input output))))))
#+end_src

This really changes things for me. I'll be more inclined to add more of these tiny integrations to lots of great command line utilities. Take this recent [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32028752][Hacker News post]] on [[https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF][ocrmypdf]] as an example. Their [[https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook.html][cookbook]] has lots of examples that can be easily used via  =dwim-shell-command--on-marked-files=.

What command line utils would you use?

* [2022-07-07 Thu] Emacs DWIM shell-command
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: emacs-dwim-shell-command
:END:
UPDATE: [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]] is now available on [[https://melpa.org/#/dwim-shell-command][melpa]].

I've [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-dwim-do-what-i-mean/][talked about DWIM before]], where I bend Emacs to help me do what I mean. Emacs is also great for [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-password-protect-current-pdf/][wrapping command-line one-liners with elisp]], so I can quickly invoke commands without thinking too much about flags, arguments, etc.

I keep thinking the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shell.html][shell-command]] is ripe for plenty of enhancements using our DWIM fairydust.

** Do what I mean how?

*** Smart template instantiation
I've drawn inspiration from [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shell-Commands-in-Dired.html][dired-do-shell-command]], which substitutes special characters like * and ? with marked files. I'm also drawing inspiration from [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][org babel]]'s [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Noweb-Reference-Syntax.html][noweb]] syntax to substitute =<<f>>= (file path), =<<fne>>= (file path without extension), and =<<e>>= (extension). My initial preference was to use something like =$f=, =$fne=, and =$e=, but felt they clashed with shell variables.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70% :height 70%
[[file:images/emacs-dwim-shell-command/template.png]]

*** Operate on dired marked files
This is DWIM, so if we're visiting a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]] buffer, the shell command should operate on all the marked files.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70% :height 70%
[[file:images/emacs-dwim-shell-command/diredmark.gif]]

*** Operate on current buffer file

Similarly, if visiting a buffer with an associated file, operate on that file instead.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 90% :height 90%
[[file:images/emacs-dwim-shell-command/blur.png]]

*** Automatically take me to created files
Did the command create a new file in the current directory? Take me to it, right away.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/emacs-dwim-shell-command/showme.png]]

*** Show me output on error

I'm not usually interested in the command output when generating new files, unless there was an error of course. Offer to show it.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70% :height 70%
[[file:images/emacs-dwim-shell-command/couldnt.png]]

*** Show me output if no new files

Not all commands generate new files, so automatically show me the output for these instances.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/emacs-dwim-shell-command/apple.gif]]

*** Make it easy to create utilities

[[https://ffmpeg.org/][ffmpeg]] is awesome, but man I can never remember all the flags and arguments. I may as well wrap commands like these in a convenient elisp function and invoke via [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/efaq/Extended-commands.html][execute-extended-command]], or my favorite [[http://oremacs.com/swiper/#minibuffer-key-bindings][counsel-M-x]] (with completion), bound to the vital =M-x=.

All those gifs you see in this post were created with =dwim-shell-command-convert-to-gif=, powered by the same elisp magic.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun dwim-shell-command-convert-to-gif ()
    "Convert all marked videos to optimized gif(s)."
    (interactive)
    (dwim-shell-command--on-marked-files
     "Convert to gif"
     "ffmpeg -loglevel quiet -stats -y -i <<f>> -pix_fmt rgb24 -r 15 <<fne>>.gif"
     :utils "ffmpeg"))
#+end_src

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 70% :height 70%
[[file:images/emacs-dwim-shell-command/togif_x1.5.gif]]

This makes wrapping one-liners a breeze, so let's do some more...

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun dwim-shell-command-convert-audio-to-mp3 ()
    "Convert all marked audio to mp3(s)."
    (interactive)
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "Convert to mp3"
     "ffmpeg -stats -n -i '<<f>>' -acodec libmp3lame '<<fne>>.mp3'"
     :utils "ffmpeg"))

  (defun dwim-shell-command-convert-image-to-jpg ()
    "Convert all marked images to jpg(s)."
    (interactive)
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "Convert to jpg"
     "convert -verbose '<<f>>' '<<fne>>.jpg'"
     :utils "convert"))

  (defun dwim-shell-command-drop-video-audio ()
    "Drop audio from all marked videos."
    (interactive)
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "Drop audio" "ffmpeg -i '<<f>>' -c copy -an '<<fne>>_no_audio.<<e>>'"
     :utils "ffmpeg"))
#+end_src

*** Make it spin ;)
Ok, not quite, but use Emacs's [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Progress.html][progress-reporter]] just for kicks.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/emacs-dwim-shell-command/progress.gif]]

** Use it everywhere

=dwim-shell-command= covers my needs (so far anyway), so I'm binding it to existing bindings.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (use-package dwim-shell-command
    :bind
    ("M-!" . dwim-shell-command))

  (use-package dired
    :bind (:map dired-mode-map
                ([remap dired-do-async-shell-command] . dwim-shell-command)
                ([remap dired-do-shell-command] . dwim-shell-command)
                ([remap dired-smart-shell-command] . dwim-shell-command)))
#+end_src

** Bring those command line utilities

On the whole, this really changes things for me. I'll be more inclined to bring command line utilities to seamless Emacs usage. Take this recent [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32028752][Hacker News post]] on [[https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF][ocrmypdf]] as an example. Their [[https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook.html][cookbook]] has lots of examples that can be easily used via =dwim-shell-command--on-marked-files=. What command line utilities would you bring?

** Where's the code?

UPDATE: [[https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command][dwim-shell-command]] is now available on [[https://melpa.org/#/dwim-shell-command][melpa]].

The code for [[https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/ar/dwim-shell-command.el][dwim-shell-command.el]] is likely a bit rough still, but you can take a peak if interested. Keep in mind this is DWIM, tailored for what ✨I✨ mean. Some of the current behavior may not be your cup of tea, but this is Emacs. You can bend it to do what ✨you✨ mean. Happy Emacsing.

:END:
UPDATE: Check out [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-password-protect-current-pdf-revisited][Password-protect current pdf (revisted)]] for a simpler version.

Every so often, I need to password-protect a pdf. On macOS, [[https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/preview/prvw587dd90f/mac][Preview has a simple solution]], but I figured there must be a command line utility to make this happen. There are options, but [[https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf][qdf]] did the job just fine.

#+begin_src sh
  qpdf --verbose --encrypt USER-PASSWORD OWNER-PASSWORD KEY-LENGTH -- input.pdf output.pdf
#+end_src

So what does ~qpdf~ have to do with Emacs? Command-line utilities are easy to invoke from Emacs via ~shell-command~ (M-!), but I don't want to remember the command nor the parameters. I may as well add a function that [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-dwim-do-what-i-mean/][does what I mean]] and password-protect either buffers or [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]] files.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun pdf-password-protect ()

:END:
[[https://plainorg.com][Plain Org]] v1.4 is now available on the [[https://apps.apple.com/app/id1578965002][App Store]].

I was on a long flight recently 🦘, so I gave list and checkbox editing a little love. There's a couple of other minor improvements included.

If you haven't heard of [[https://plainorg.com][Plain Org]], it gives you access to [[https://orgmode.org][org]] files on iPhone while away from your beloved [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]].

I love org markup, but we (iPhone + org users) are a fairly niche bunch. If you're finding Plain Org useful, *please help support this effort* by getting the word out. Tell your friends, [[https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Plain%20Org%20https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid1578965002%20][tweet]], or blog about it.

On to v1.4 release notes...

** Improved list/checkbox editing

Adding list or checkbox items is traditionally cumbersome via the iPhone's keyboard. This release adds new toolbar actions and smart return to simplify things.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/plain-org-v14-released/list_this.gif]]

** Render form feed characters

Form feed characters are now rendered within expanded headings.

[[file:images/plain-org-v14-released/form_feed.jpg]]

Note: There's a limitation. Form feed characters at the end of a heading aren't currently displayed.

** Other

Increased all button tap areas in edit toolbar. This should hopefully improve interaction.

The previous screenshot text comes from [[http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html][Org Mode - Organize Your Life In Plain Text]], a magnificent org resource.

** Deadline and scheduled date rendered

In the past, =SCHEDULED= and =DEADLINE= were rendered (but only one of them at a time). Now both are rendered alongside each other (deadline has an orange tint).

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/plain-org-v130-released/deadline_scheduled.png]]

** Other bug fixes improvements

- Disable raw text edit menu when file is not accessible.
- Minor improvements to inline editing layouts (vertical height and drawers).
- ABRT and HABIT now recognized as a popular keywords.
- Improve state transition alignment to match org mode behaviour.
- Fixes roundtripping state transition notes (leading to data loss).

On to v1.2.1 release notes...

** Render LOGBOOK
State transitions and LOGBOOK drawers are now recognized and rendered as such.

Either of the following snippets are rendered as togglable LOGBOOK drawers.

#+begin_src org
  ,* TODO Feed the fish
  - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2022-03-11 Fri 12:23]

** Add task to top/bottom
Up until now, tasks were always appended to the bottom of things. This didn't work so well if you like seeing recent items bubbling up to the top.

This version adds a new setting: /Settings/ > /Add new tasks to/ > /Top/Bottom/, giving you the choice.

Note: Top is the new default value, please change this setting if you'd like to keep the previous behaviour.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%

** Checking for changes
Local file changes aren't always detected via [[https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocument/1619945-statechangednotification][state change notifications]], so additional checks are now in place to offer reloading files.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%

After adding new tasks via iOS's share sheet, if the item was added to a file other than the active one, offer to open that instead.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/plain-org-v121-released/load_other.jpg]]

** Other improvements
- Color keyword red/green depending on #+TODO: position.
- Round-trip planning order (SCHEDULED, CLOSED, DEADLINE).
- Improve tag alignment to match org mode behaviour (best effort, sorry).
- Improve vertical spacing prior to lists.
- Improve share sheet reliability.
- Fix opening local links from list items.
- Fix indent for list items without previous content.
- Fix race condition in adding TITLE and ID to new files.
- Fix incorrect keyword color selection in search toolbar.
- Fix menu inadvertently closing.
- Fix menu tapping for iPad.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: emacs-dwim-swiper-vs-isearch-vs-phi-search
:END:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/emacs-dwim-swiper-vs-isearch-vs-phi-search/search-dwim.gif]]

I've [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-dwim-do-what-i-mean/][talked about DWIM]] in the past, that wonderful Emacs ability to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM][do what ✨I✨ mean]].

Emacs being hyper-configurable, we can always teach it more things, so it can do exactly what we mean.

There are no shortages of buffer searching packages for Emacs. I'm a fan of Oleh Krehel's [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][swiper]], but before that, I often relied on the built-in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Basic-Isearch.html][isearch]]. Swiper is my default goto mechanism and have it bound to =C-s= (replacing the built-in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Basic-Isearch.html][isearch-forward]]).

Swiper services most needs until I start combining with other tools. Take [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Keyboard-Macros.html][keyboard macros]] and [[https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el][multiple cursors]]. Both wonderful, but neither can rely on swiper to do their thing. Ok, swiper does, but [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-swiper-and-multiple-cursors/][in a different way]].

Rather than binding =C-s= to swiper, let's write a DWIM function that's aware of macros and multiple cursors. It must switch between swiper, isearch, and [[https://github.com/avkoval/phi-search][phi-search]] depending on what I want (search buffer, define macro, or search multiple cursors).

Let's also tweak swiper's behavior a little further and prepopulate its search term with the active region. Oh, and I also would like swiper to wrap around (see [[http://oremacs.com/swiper/][ivy-wrap]]). But only swiper, not other ivy utilities. I know, I'm picky, but that's the whole point of DWIM... so here's my function to search forward that does exactly what ✨I✨ mean:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (defun ar/swiper-isearch-dwim ()

The above snippet searches forward, but I'm feeling a little off-balance. Let's write an equivalent to search backwards. We can then bind it to =C-r=, also overriding the built-in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Basic-Isearch.html][isearch-backward]].

  [[file:images/grandmas-vanilla-pound-cake/pound_cake.jpg]]

  My grandmother Hilda used to bake this for us grandkids. I don't know the origin of the recipe, but my parents, aunts, and cousins, they all bake it too. I'm a big fan, but only get to eat it when visiting. Yesterday, I changed that. Finally baked it myself \o/
** Ingredients
- 200g salted butter
- 2 cups (400 g) sugar
- 4 eggs
- 3 cups (375 g) plain flour
- 3 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 tablespoon (15 ml) vanilla extract
- 1 cup (250 ml) milk
- 2 tablespoons (30 ml) Málaga Virgen wine (port works too)
** Prep
- Ensure all ingredients are at room temperature before you start.
- Preheat oven at 175C.
- Separate egg yolks and whites. Keep both.
- Consolidate liquids into a bowl (milk + wine + vanilla).
- Consolidate sifted powders into a bowl (flour + baking powder).
** Meringue
- Beat egg whites into a snowy meringue. Set aside.
** Mixer
- Beat butter in the mixer until creamy (important).
- Add sugar and mix thoroughly ensuring creamy consistency remains (important).
- Mix yolks in thoroughly one by one.
- Mix in the meringue.
- You're done with the mixer.
** Hand mixing
- With a wooden spoon, alternate hand mixing the liquids and the powders. Start with liquids and end with powders.
** Pour into mould
- Pour the mix into a non-stick baking mould.
** Bake
- Bake in oven between 60 and 70 mins, but don’t be afraid to leave longer if needed. Mileage varies across ovens.
- Use a cake tester after 60 minutes to decide how much longer to bake for (if needed).
* [2022-03-05 Sat] Emacs: viewing webp images
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: emacs-viewing-webp-images
:END:
There's a recent reddit post asking how to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/t76isx/viewing_webp_images_in_emacs/][view webp images in Emacs]]. I didn't know the answer, but it's something I had wanted for some time. This post was a nice reminder to go and check things out. Was happy to [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/t76isx/comment/hzft7ww/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][contribute an answer]].

Turns out, it's very simple. Just set =image-use-external-converter= and install relevant external tools.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (setq image-use-external-converter t)
#+end_src

I'm a =use-package= user, so I prefer to set with:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (use-package image
    :custom
    ;; Enable converting external formats (ie. webp) to internal ones.
    (image-use-external-converter t))
#+end_src

So what are the external tools needed? =C-h v= =image-use-external-converter= gives us the info we need:

#+begin_quote
If non-nil, create-image will use external converters for exotic formats.

Emacs handles most of the common image formats (SVG, JPEG, PNG, GIF
and some others) internally, but images that don't have native
support in Emacs can still be displayed if an external conversion
program (like ImageMagick "convert", GraphicsMagick "gm"
or "ffmpeg") is installed.

This variable was added, or its default value changed, in Emacs 27.1.
#+end_quote

I happen to be a macOS user, so I install ImageMagick with:

#+begin_src sh
  brew install imagemagick

When building software for the Apple ecosystem, Xcode is often the editor of choice. With [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] being my personal preference, I rarely find other iOS devs with a similar mindset.

When I saw [[https://twitter.com/konrad1977][Mikael Konradsson]]'s post describing [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sndriv/i_finally_got_full_autocompetion_in_swift_with/][his Emacs Swift development setup]], I reached out to say hello. While exchanging tips and tricks, the topic of searching Apple's docs came up. It had been a while since I looked into this, so it was a great reminder to revisit the space.

Back in June 2020, I wrote a snippet to [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-search-hackingwithswiftcom/][fuzzy search hackingwithswift.com]], using Emacs's [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]] completion framework. With a similar online API, we could also search Apple's docs. Turns out, there is and we can we can use it to search [[https://developer.apple.com/search][developer.apple.com]] from our beloved editor.

:END:

Although [[https://plainorg.com][Plain Org]] v1.2 has been in the [[https://apps.apple.com/app/id1578965002][App Store]] for a little while, the release write-up was overdue, sorry. The update receives some new features and bugfixes.

If you haven't heard of [[https://plainorg.com][Plain Org]], it gives ya access to your [[https://orgmode.org][org files]] on iOS while away from your beloved [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]].

If you're finding Plain Org useful, *please help support this effort* by getting the word out. Tell your friends, [[https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Plain%20Org%20https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid1578965002%20][tweet]], or blog about it.

Ok, now on to what's included in the v1.2 release...

** Edit heading sections inline

v1.0 introduced outline editing (for headings only). In v1.2, we can also edit section content. Press the =return=
 key multiple times to exit out section editing.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/plain-org-v12-released/inline.gif]]

** Filter by keyword/priority/tag

From the search dialog, you can now filter by keyboard, priority, and tag.

[[file:images/plain-org-v12-released/drawer.gif]]

** Open files via the Files app's "Share" sheet

From the Files app, you can now explicitly request launching files in Plain Org by using the "Share" menu.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/plain-org-v12-released/share.png]]

** Render LaTeX src blocks (experimental)

This one has its rough edges at the moment, so have to mark it _experimental_, but... you can can now render =#+begin_src latex= blocks.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/plain-org-v12-released/latex_src.png]]

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/plain-org-v12-released/latex_render.png]]

** Insert title/id in new files
New files created via Plain Org automatically get =#+TITLE:= and =:ID:= inserted by default as follows:

#+begin_src org
  ,#+TITLE: My favorite title
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       7C845D38-8D80-41B5-BEB1-94F673807355
  :END:
#+end_src

/UPDATE/: Sorry, this feature currently has a bug. You may not get these values inserted into your new document. Working on a fix.

** Adding new tags quicker
Add tags quicker via the new + button.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/plain-org-v12-released/new_tag.png]]

** Enable/disable sticky tags

Keywords, indent, and tags are maintained when adding new headings via outline editing. If you prefer disabling sticky tags, this can now be disabled.

[[file:images/plain-org-v12-released/sticky_tags_setting.png]]

** Improved navigation bar

v1.2 makes the navigation bar feel more at home on your iPhone. It uses a large title which scrolls into the navigation bar.

** Bugfixes
- Fix table rendering for iPad width.
- Fix image's horizontal padding.
- Fix adding new tags on new headings.
- Fix snapshotting bug resulting in Syncthing conflicts.
- Fix tapping menu after presenting other dialogs.
- Filter out parenthesis in file-local keywords like =TODO(t)=.
- Commit pending inline changes if search is requested.
- Fix opening local links inside tables.
- Roundtrip whitespace in empty headings.
- Roundtrip trailing whitespace when raw-editing heading content.
- Tapping on body content should not toggle expansion.

* [2022-01-03 Mon] Happy New Year and forming new habits
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: happy-new-year-and-forming-new-habits
:END:
Hacker News has a [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29774859][summary of Atomic Habits]] (the [[https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits][book]]). In my case, I really enjoyed reading the entire book. I liked its narrative, mixing _actionable_ and _concrete_ advice with personal stories and experiments.

After reading Atomic Habits during the first lockdown, I was excited to try out its actionables, specially tracking to keep me honest.

I tried a bunch of iOS apps, but wanted no friction, no tracking, no cloud, no social, no analytics, no account, etc. so eventually
[[https://xenodium.com/frictionless-org-habits-on-ios/][built Flat Habits]] ([[https://flathabits.com][flathabits.com]]). Also wanted to own my habit data (as plain text), so I made sure Flat Habits stored its data locally as an org file.

I'm an Emacs nutter and can say the strength in habit tracking lies in removing daily friction from the tracking process itself. A quickly accessible mobile app can really help with that. For me, Emacs plays a less important role here. The plain text part is cherry on top (bringing piece of mind around lock-in). In my case, it's been months since I looked at the plain text file itself from an Emacs org buffer. The iOS app, on the other hand, gets daily usage.

As for forming lasting habits (the actual goal here)... it's been well over a year since I started running as a regular form of exercise. While reading Atomic Habits really changed how I think of habits, a tracker played a crucial part in the daily grind. I happen to have built a tracker that [[https://xenodium.com/flat-habits-meets-org-agenda/][plays nice with Emacs]].

It's a new year. If you're looking at forming new habits, you may want some inspiration and also practical and concrete guidance. The book Atomic Habits can help with that. You can decide on which apps and how to implement the tracking process later on. Pen and paper is also a viable option and there are plenty of templates you can download.

There's a surplus of habit-tracking apps on the app stores. I built yet another one for iOS, modeled after my needs.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: plain-org-v11-released
:END:
[[https://plainorg.com][Plain Org]] v1.1 is now available on the [[https://apps.apple.com/app/id1578965002][App Store]]. The update receives new features and bugfixes.

If you're finding Plain Org useful, *please help support this effort* by getting the word out. Tell your friends, [[https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Plain%20Org%20https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid1578965002%20][tweet]], or blog about it.

** What is Plain Org?

Ok, now on to what's included in the v1.1 release...

** Compact mode

By default, Plain Org layout uses generous padding. The new option =Menu -> View -> Compact mode= packs more content into your screen.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/plain-org-v11-released/compact.gif]]

** Regroup active and inactive tasks

Regrouping tasks now bubbles active ones up. Similarly, inactive tasks drop to the bottom of their node. Changes are persisted to the org file.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/plain-org-v11-released/regroup.gif]]

** Native table rendering

Tables are now rendered natively but also support displaying links and other formatting within cells.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/plain-org-v11-released/table.gif]]

** Open local ID links

If your file provider supports granting access to folders, local ID links (ie. ~id:eb155a82-92b2-4f25-a3c6-0304591af2f9~) can now be resolved and opened from Plain Org. Note that for ID links to resolve, other org files must live in either the same directory or a subdirectory.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/plain-org-v11-released/idlink.gif]]

** Fill paragraphs

If your org paragraphs contain newlines optimizing for bigger screens, you can toggle =Menu -> View -> Fill paragraph= to optimize rendering for your iPhone. This rendering option makes no file modifications.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/plain-org-v11-released/fillparagraph.gif]]

By the way, the previous screenshot text comes from [[http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html][Org Mode - Organize Your Life In Plain Text]], a magnificent org resource.

** Show/hide basic scheduling

Use the new =Menu -> View -> Scheduling= to toggle showing ~SCHEDULED~ or ~DEADLINE~ dates.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/plain-org-v11-released/scheduling.gif]]


** Show/hide tags

Similarly, the new =Menu -> View -> Tags= option toggles displaying tags.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/plain-org-v11-released/hidetags.gif]]


** Native list rendering

Lists are now rendered natively. With the exception of numbered cases, list items now share a common bullet icon. Description lists are also recognized and receive additional formatting when rendered.

#+begin_src org
 - First list item
 * Second list item
 + Third list item
 1. Numbered list item
 + Term :: Description for term
#+end_src

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 30% :height 30%
[[file:images/plain-org-v11-released/listitems.png]]

Numbered checkboxes are now recognized and receive the same formatting and interaction as their non-numbered counterparts.

#+begin_src org
 1. [ ] First checkbox
 2. [X] Second checkbox
 3. [X] Third checkbox
#+end_src

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 30% :height 30%
[[file:images/plain-org-v11-released/numbered.png]]

** Reload current file

Plain Org may not be able to automatically reload files for some syncing providers. In those instances, use =Menu -> Reload= to explicitly request a reload.

** Open .txt files

Although .org files are plain text files, they aren't always recognized by other text-editing apps. This release enables opening .txt files, so you can choose to render them in Plain Org, while giving you the option to edit elsewhere.

** Bugfixes

- Improve vertical whitespace handling.
- Fixes rendering edge cases.
- Fail gracefully when creating new files on unsupported cloud providers.
- Prevent creating new files with redundant extensions.
- File access improvements.
- Replicates property spacing behaviour using Emacs's ~org-property-format~ default value.
- Fixes keyword picker border rendering.
- Improves rendering performance for large nodes.

:END:
While adding more rendering capabilities to [[https://plainorg.com][Plain Org]], it soon became apparent some sort of screenshot/snapshot testing was necessary to prevent regressing existing features. That is, we first generate a rendered snapshot from a given org snippet, followed by some visual inspection, right before we go and save the blessed snapshot (often referred to as golden) to our project. Future changes are validated against the golden snapshot to ensure rendering is still behaving as expected.

Let's say we'd like to validate table rendering with links, we can write a test as follows:

#+begin_src swift
  func testTableWithLinks() throws {
    assertSnapshot(
      matching: OrgMarkupText.make(
        """
        | URL                    | Org link    |
        |------------------------+-------------|
        | https://flathabits.com | [[https://flathabits.com][Flat Habits]] |
        | Regular text           | Here too    |
        |------------------------+-------------|
        """),
      as: .image(layout: .sizeThatFits))
  }

The corresponding snapshot golden can be seen below.

This is all done rather effortlessly thanks to [[https://twitter.com/pointfreeco][Point Free]]'s wonderful [[https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing][swift-snapshot-testing]] utilities.

So what does any of this have to do with Emacs? You see, as I added more snapshot tests and made modifications to the rendering logic, I needed a quick way to visually inspect and override all goldens. All the main pieces were already there, I just needed some elisp glue to /bend Emacs my way™./

First, I needed to run my Xcode builds from the command line. This is already [[https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2339/_index.html][supported via xcodebuild]]. Next, I needed a way to parse test execution data to extract failing tests. [[https://twitter.com/davidahouse][David House]]'s [[https://github.com/davidahouse/xcodebuild-to-json][xcodebuild-to-json]] handles this perfectly. What's left? Glue it all up with some elisp.

Beware, the following code snippet is packed with assumptions about my project, it's messy, surely has bugs, can be optimized, etc. But the important point here is that Emacs is such an amazing malleable power tool. Throw some elisp at it and you can to bend it to your liking. After all, it's _your_ editor.

And so here we are, I can now run snapshot tests from Emacs using my hacked up ~plainorg-snapshot-test-all~ function and quickly override (or ignore) all newly generated snapshots by merely pressing y/n keys. Oh, and our beloved web browser was also invited to the party. Press "d" to open two browser tabs if you'd like to take a closer look (not demoed below).

Success. /Emacs bends again/.

* [2021-11-10 Wed] Plain Org has joined the chat (iOS)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: plain-org-has-joined-the-chat
:END:
The App Store is a crowded space when it come to markdown apps. A quick search yields a wonderful wealth of choice. Kinda overwhelming, but a great problem to have nonetheless.

For those of us with org as our markup of choice, the App Store is far less crowded. I wish we could fill more than a screen's worth of search results, so you know... I could show you another pretty gif scrolling through org results. For now, we'll settle on a single frame showcasing our 4 org options.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80%
[[file:images/plain-org-has-joined-the-chat/store-side-comparison-mid.gif]]

[[https://beorg.app/][Beorg]], [[http://mobileorg.github.io/][MobileOrg]], [[https://flathabits.com/][Flat Habits]], and [[https://orgro.org/][Orgro]] are all great options. Each with strengths of their own. [[https://organice.200ok.ch/][Organice]], while not on the App Store, is another option for those looking for a web alternative. Of these, I had already authored one of them. More on that in a sec... You see, about a year ago I wanted to play with Swift, SPM, and lsp itself. Also, having Swift code completion in Emacs via [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-sourcekit][lsp-sourcekit]] sounded like a fun thing to try out, so I started using it while writing a Swift org parser.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75%
[[file:images/plain-org-has-joined-the-chat/magit.png]]

While working on the parser, I happened to be reading [[https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits][Atomic Habits]] (awesome book btw)... It was also a great time to play around with SwiftUI, which by the way, is pretty awesome too. With Atomic Habits fresh in mind, org parser in one hand, and SwiftUI in the other, I built [[https://flathabits.com][Flat Habits]]: a lightweight habit tracker powered by org.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80% :height 80%
[[file:images/frictionless-org-habits-on-ios/flat_habits.gif]]

I love being able to save habit data to plain text and easily track on my iPhone (via Flat Habits) or laptop (via Emacs). I wanted to [[https://xenodium.com/org-habits-on-ios-check-tasks-youre-next/][extend similar convenience to org tasks]], so I built [[https://plainorg.com][Plain Org]].

My previous [[https://xenodium.com/org-habits-on-ios-check-tasks-youre-next/][post]] mentioned /quickly adding new tasks and searching existing ones/ as Plain Org's driving goals. Of course, neither of those are as useful without automatic cloud syncing, so pluging into [[https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT206481#thirdparty][iOS's third party cloud support]] was a must-have.

With these baseline features in place, I [[https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/p5bonn/ios_plain_org_alpha_builds_now_on_testflight_dm/][started an alpha/beta group]] via [[https://testflight.apple.com/][TestFlight]]. Early Plain Org adopters have been wonderfully supportive, given lots of great feedback, and helped shape the initial feature set you see below.

/There's plenty more that can be supported, but hey let's get v1 out the door. Gotta start somewhere./

** Plain Org v1 features

- View and edit your org mode tasks while on the go.
- Beautifully rendered org markup.
- Sync your org files using your favorite cloud provider.
- Create new files.
- Outline-style editing with toolbar
    - Keywords
    - Indent
    - Priority
    - Tags
    - Formatting: bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, verbatim, and code.
- Add links from Safari via share extension.
- Add new tasks via Spotlight.
- Reorder headings via drag/drop.
- Checkboxes
    - Interactive toggling.
    - Quickly reset multiple checkboxes.
- Follow local links.
- Show inline images.
- File-local keywords and visibility.
- Filter open/closed tasks.
- Show/hide stars.
- Edit raw text.
- Light/dark mode.

** Plain Org joins the chat
Today Plain Org joins the likes of [[https://beorg.app/][Beorg]], [[http://mobileorg.github.io/][MobileOrg]], [[https://flathabits.com/][Flat Habits]], and [[https://orgro.org/][Orgro]] on the App Store.

A month ago, I posted about my desire to [[https://xenodium.com/org-habits-on-ios-check-tasks-youre-next/][bring org tasks/TODOs to iOS]] and make them quickly available from my iPhone.

Since then, I've received some great feedback, which I've been slowly chipping away at. My intent isn't so much to move my org workflow over to iOS, but to supplement Emacs while away from my laptop.

As of now, this is what the inline edit experience looks like:

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org-habits-on-ios-check-tasks-youre-next
:END:
I'm an [[https://orgmode.org][org mode]] fan. This blog is powered by org. It's more of an accidental blog that started as a [[https://github.com/xenodium/xenodium.github.io/blob/master/index.org][single org file]] keeping notes. I use [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html][org babel]] too. Oh and [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Tracking-your-habits.html][org habits]]. My never-ending list of TODOs is also powered by org. I manage all of this from Emacs and peek at TODOs using [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-Views.html][org agenda]]. This all works really well while I'm sitting in front of my laptop running Emacs.

But then I'm away from my laptop... and I need to quickly record habits on the go. I need it to be low-friction. Ssh'ing to an Emacs instance from a smartphone isn't an option. I'm an iPhone user, so whatever the solution, it should play nice with Emacs and org mode. I built [[https://flathabits.com][Flat Habits]] for habit tracking and I'm fairly happy with the result. As of today, my longest-tracked habit is on a 452-day streak.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 80% :height 80%
[[file:images/frictionless-org-habits-on-ios/flat_habits.gif]]

Moving on to org tasks/TODOs... I want something fairly frictionless while on the go. With /Flat Habits/ as a stepping stone, I can now reuse some parts to build [[https://reddit.com/r/plainorg][Plain Org]]. This new app should give me quick access to my tasks. The two driving goals are: quickly add new tasks and search existing ones while away from my laptop. Ok, maybe basic editing helps too. Oh and it should sync over cloud, of course.

* [2021-07-11 Sun] Flat Habits 1.1 released
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: flat-habits-11-released
:END:
[[https://flathabits.com/][Flat Habits]] 1.1 is now available on the [[https://apps.apple.com/app/id1558358855][App Store]]. Flat Habits is a habit tracker that’s mindful of your time, data, and privacy. It's powered by [[https://orgmode.org][org]] plain text markup, enabling you to use your [[https://xenodium.com/frictionless-org-habits-on-ios/][favorite editor]] (Emacs, Vim, VSCode, etc.) to poke at your habit data.

** What's new?

This release implements a few of features requested by users.

** Multiday weekly habits

This is the chunkiest addition and most requested feature. You can now select multiple days when scheduling weekly habits.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/flat-habits-11-released/multi_day_creation.gif]]

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/flat-habits-11-released/multi_day_calendar.png]]

** Historical management

Sometimes you forget to mark a habit done or make a mistake toggling one. Either way, you can now toggle any habit day from the calendar/streak view.

*** Long tap

Long tap shows you the editing option available for that day.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/flat-habits-11-released/long_tap.gif]]

*** Short tap

Short tap typically toggles between "Done" and "Not done".

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/flat-habits-11-released/short_tap.gif]]

** Where's today?

A few folks rightfully asked for today's date to be highlighted in the calendar view, and so we now have a red circle.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/flat-habits-11-released/today.png]]

** Improved error messages

Hopefully you don't run into issues, but if you do, I hope the app helps ya sort them out.

** Bugfixes

- Tapping on blur now dismisses habit edit dialog.
- Future habits now longer editable.
- Skipped habits no longer have a default tap action.
- Undoing from streak/calendar view now refreshes correctly.
- Undoing habit addition on iPad removes streak/calendar view.
* [2021-07-11 Sun] macOS: Show in Finder / Show in Emacs
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: show-in-finder--show-in-emacs
:END:

From Christian Tietze's [[https://christiantietze.de/posts/2021/07/open-finder-window-in-dired/][Open macOS Finder Window in Emacs Dired]], I learned about [[https://github.com/kaz-yos/reveal-in-osx-finder][reveal-in-osx-finder]]. This is handy for the few times I want to transition from Emacs to Finder for file management. I say few times since Emacs's directory editor, [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][dired]], is just awesome. I've written about dired customizations [[https://xenodium.com/showhide-emacs-dired-details-in-style/][here]] and [[https://xenodium.com/showhide-emacs-dired-details-in-style/][here]], but since dired is /just another buffer,/ you can apply your Emacs magic like multiple cursors to [[https://xenodium.com/batch-renaming-with-counsel-find-dired-and-wdired/][batch rename files in an editable dired buffer]].

To transition from macOS Finder to Emacs, Christian offers an Emacs interactive command that fetches Finder's location and opens a dired buffer via AppleScript. On a similar note, I learned from redditor [[https://www.reddit.com/user/pndc/][u/pndc]] that [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ohgz0s/open_macos_finder_windows_path_in_dired/h4p8a8f?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3][Finder's proxy icons can be dragged over to Emacs]], which handily drops ya into a dired buffer.

With these two solutions in mind, I looked into a third one to offer a context menu option in Finder to show the file in Emacs. This turned out to be fairly easy using Automator, which I've rarely used.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/show-in-finder--show-in-emacs/show_in_emacs.gif]]

I created a flow that runs a shell script to "Show in Emacs", revealing the selected file or folder in an dired buffer. This is similar to Christian's solution, but invoked from Finder itself. The flow also uses /dired-goto-file/ which moves the point (cursor) to the file listed under dired.

  path/to/emacsclient --eval "(progn (dired \"$current_dir\") (dired-goto-file \"$1\"))"
#+end_src

As a bonus, I added an "Open in Emacs" option, which does as it says on the tin. Rather than show the file listed in a dired buffer, it gets Emacs to open it in your favorite major mode. This option is not technically needed since Finder already provides an "Open With" context menu, but it does remove a few click here and there.

On a side note, Emacs defaults to creating new frames when opening files via "Open With" menu (or "open -a Emacs foo.txt"). I prefer to use my existing Emacs frame, which can be accomplished by setting ns-pop-up-frames to nil.

:END:
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/emacs-smarter-search-and-replace/smarter_replace.gif]]

Not long ago, I made a note to go back and read [[https://mac4translators.blogspot.com][Mac for Translators]]'s [[https://mac4translators.blogspot.com/2021/06/regex-with-elisp.html][Emacs regex with Emacs lisp]] post. The author highlights Emacs's ability to apply additional logic when replacing text during a search-and-replace session. It does so by leveraging elisp expressions.

Coincidentally, a redditor recently asked [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/o878am/what_is_the_simplest_way_to_apply_a_math_formula/][What is the simplest way to apply a math formula to all numbers in a buffer/region?]] Some of the answers also point to /search and replace/ leveraging elisp expressions.

While I rarely need to apply additional logic when replacing matches, it's nice to know we have options  available in our Emacs toolbox. This prompted me to check out [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/b8f9e58ef72402e69a1f0960816184d52e5d2d29/lisp/replace.el#L709][replace-regexp]]'s documentation (via M-x [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Name-Help.html][describe-function]] or my favorite M-x [[https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful][helpful-callable]]). There's lots in there. Go check its docs out. You may be pleasantly surprised by all the features packed under this humble function.

For instance, \& expands to the current match. Similarly, \#& expands to the current match, fed through [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/String-Conversion.html][string-to-number]]. But what if you'd like to feed the match to another function? You can use \, to signal evaluation of an elisp expression. In other words, you could multiply by 3 using \,(* 3 \#&) or inserting whether a number is odd or even with something like \,(if (oddp \#&) "(odd)" "(even)").

Take the following text:

#+begin_example
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6
#+end_example

We can label each value "(odd)" or "(even)" as well as multiply by 3, by invoking /replace-regexp/ as follows:

#+begin_quote
  M-x replace-regexp
#+end_quote

[PCRE] Replace regex:
#+begin_quote
  [-0-9.]+
#+end_quote

Replace regex [-0-9.]+:
#+begin_quote
  \& \,(if (oddp \#&) "(odd)" "(even)") x 3 = \,(* 3 \#&)
#+end_quote

#+begin_example
  1 (odd) x 3 = 3
  2 (even) x 3 = 6
  3 (odd) x 3 = 9
  4 (even) x 3 = 12
  5 (odd) x 3 = 15
  6 (even) x 3 = 18
#+end_example

It's worth noting that /replace-regexp/'s cousin [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Query-Replace.html][query-replace-regexp]] also handles all this wonderful magic.

Happy searching and replacing!

* [2021-06-20 Sun] Previewing SwiftUI layouts in Emacs (revisited)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: previewing-swiftui-layouts-in-emacs-revisited
:END:
Back in May 2020, I shared a snippet to extend [[https://github.com/zweifisch/ob-swift][ob-swift]] to [[https://xenodium.com/swiftui-layout-previews-using-emacs-org-blocks/][preview SwiftUI layouts using Emacs org blocks]].

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/swiftui-layout-previews-using-emacs-org-blocks/ob-swiftui.gif]]

When I say extend, I didn't quite modify ob-swift itself, but rather [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Advising-Functions.html][advised]] [[https://github.com/zweifisch/ob-swift/blob/ed478ddbbe41ce5373efde06b4dd0c3663c9055f/ob-swift.el#L37][org-babel-execute:swift]] to modify its behavior at runtime.

Fast-forward to June 2021 and Scott Nicholes [[https://github.com/zweifisch/ob-swift/issues/4#issuecomment-858196354][reminded me there's still interest]] in org babel SwiftUI support. ob-swift [[https://github.com/zweifisch/ob-swift/commits/master][seems a little inactive]], but no worries there. The package offers great general-purpose Swift support. On the other hand, SwiftUI previews can likely live as a single-purpose package all on its own... and so I set off to bundle the rendering functionality into a new [[https://github.com/xenodium/ob-swiftui][ob-swiftui]] package.

Luckily, org babel's documentation has a straightforward section to help you [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/index.html][develop support for new babel languages]]. They simplified things by offering [[https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/worg/raw/master/org-contrib/babel/ob-template.el][template.el]], which serves as the foundation for your language implementation. For the most part, it's a matter of searching, replacing strings, and removing the bits you don't need.

The elisp core of ob-swiftui is fairly simple. It expands the org block body, inserts the expanded body into a temporary buffer, and finally feeds the code to the Swift toolchain for execution.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun org-babel-execute:swiftui (body params)
    "Execute a block of SwiftUI code in BODY with org-babel header PARAMS.
  This function is called by `org-babel-execute-src-block'"
    (message "executing SwiftUI source code block")
    (with-temp-buffer
      (insert (ob-swiftui--expand-body body params))
      (shell-command-on-region
       (point-min)
       (point-max)
       "swift -" nil 't)
      (buffer-string)))
#+end_src

The expansion in /ob-swiftui--expand-body/ is a little more interesting. It decorates the block's body, so it can become a fully functional and stand-alone SwiftUI macOS app. If you're familiar with Swift and SwiftUI, the code should be fairly self-explanatory.

From an org babel's perspective, the expanded code is executed whenever we press /C-c C-c/ (or M-x [[https://orgmode.org/manual/The-Very-Busy-C_002dc-C_002dc-Key.html#The-Very-Busy-C_002dc-C_002dc-Key][org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c]]) within the block itself.

It's worthing mentioning that our new implementation supports two babel [[https://www.orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/header-args.html][header arguments]] (results and view). Both extracted from params using [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/3af9e84ff59811734dcbb5d55e04e1fdb7051e77/lisp/emacs-lisp/map.el#L106][map-elt]] and replaced in the expanded Swift code to enable/disable snapshotting or explicitly setting a SwiftUI root view.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ob-swiftui--expand-body (body params)
    "Expand BODY according to PARAMS and PROCESSED-PARAMS, return the expanded body."
    (let ((write-to-file (member "file" (map-elt params :result-params)))
          (root-view (when (and (map-elt params :view)
                                (not (string-equal (map-elt params :view) "none")))
                       (map-elt params :view))))

For rendering inline SwiftUI previews in Emacs, we rely on NSView's [[https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/1483440-bitmapimagerepforcachingdisplay][bitmapImageRepForCachingDisplay]] to capture an image snapshot. We write its output to a temporary file and piggyback-ride off org babel's /:results file/ header argument to automatically render the image inline.

Here's ob-swiftui inline rendering in action:

[[file:images/previewing-swiftui-layouts-in-emacs-revisited/obswiftui50.gif]]

When rendering SwiftUI externally, we're effectively running and interacting with the generated macOS app itself.

He writes about [[https://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/3996068979/the-levels-of-emacs-proficiency][the levels of Emacs proficiency]]. All 6 levels are insightful in their own right, but for the sake of this post, let's quote an extract from level /4. Shell inside Emacs/:

#+begin_quote
"And then, you learned about it: M-x shell.

It was all just text. Why did you need another application for it? Why should only the shell prompt be editable? Why can’t I move my cursor up a few lines to where the last command spewed out its results? All these problems simply disappear when your shell (or shells) simply becomes another Emacs buffer, upon which all of the text manipulation power of Emacs can be brought to bear."
#+end_quote

In other words, we aren't merely removing shell restrictions, but opening up possibilities...

Take Emacs eshell looping, for example. I use it so infrequently, I could never remember eshell's syntax. I would refer back to EmacsWiki's [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EshellForLoop][Eshell For Loop]] or Mastering Emacs's [[https://masteringemacs.org/article/complete-guide-mastering-eshell][Mastering Eshell]] comments for a reminder. It finally dawned on me. I don't need to internalize this eshell syntax. I have [[https://github.com/joaotavora/YASnippet][YASnippet]] available like any other buffer. I could just type "for" and let YASnippet do the rest for me.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%

All I need is a tiny YASnippet:

If you're a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shell-Mode.html][shell-mode]] user, YASnippet would have you covered in your favorite shell. The expansion snippet can be modified to a Bash equivalent, giving us the same benefit. We type "for" and let YASnippet expand and hop over arguments. Here's a Bash equivalent emphasizing the hopping a little more:

Xcode can handle Swift packages directly. Similarly, xcodebuild can handle them too. This isn't new. It's likely been available since Xcode 11. I just totally missed it.

/Note: I've yet to dig into Xcode 13 beta, as Swift packages may already support the build/test features I was after in xcodebuild (like [[https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/supportedplatform/3788290-maccatalyst][build/test on Catalyst]])./

In any case, on to xcodebuild... but let's first create a brand new Swift package.

Update: There's a DWIM [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-dwim-swiper-vs-isearch-vs-phi-search/][follow-up for searching]].

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/emacs-dwim-do-what-i-mean/do-what-i-mean.gif]]

I was a rather puzzled the first time I spotted DWIM in an Emacs interactive command name. Don't think I remember what the command itself was, but what's important here is that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM][DWIM]] stands for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM][do what I mean]].

I love DWIM interactive commands. They enable commands to be smarter and thus pack more functionality, without incurring the typical cognitive overhead associated with remembering multiple commands (or key bindings). The Emacs manual does a great job describing DWIM for the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Comment-Commands.html][comment-dwim]] command:

#+begin_src
 The word “dwim” is an acronym for “Do What I Mean”; it indicates that this command can be used for many different jobs relating to comments, depending on the situation where you use it.
#+end_src

It's really great to find built-in DWIM-powered Emacs commands. Third-party packages often include them too. I typically gravitate towards these commands and bind them in my Emacs config. Examples being upcase-dwim, downcase-dwim, or mc/mark-all-dwim.

But what if the DWIM command doesn't exist or the author has written a command for what /they/ mean? This is your editor, so you can make it do what /you/ mean.

Take for example, [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Handling-Links.html][org-insert-link]], bound to /C-c C-l/ by default. It's handy for inserting [[https://orgmode.org/guide/Hyperlinks.html][org mode links]]. I used it so frequently that I quickly internalized its key binding. Having said that, I often found myself doing some lightweight preprocessing prior to invoking /org-insert-link/. What if I can /make org-insert-link do what I mean/?

** What do I mean?

*** Use URLs when in clipboard

If the URL is already in the clipboard, don't ask me for it. Just use it.

*** Use the region too

If I have a region selected and there's a URL in the clipboard, just sort it out without user interaction.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/emacs-dwim-do-what-i-mean/do-what-i-mean.gif]]

*** Fallback to org-insert-link

If my DWIM rules don't apply, fall back to using good ol' [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Handling-Links.html][org-insert-link]].

My most common use case here is when editing an existing link where I don't want neither its title nor URL automatically handled.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/emacs-dwim-do-what-i-mean/edit-link.gif]]

** The code

This is your own DWIM command that does what /you/ mean. Strive to write a clean implementation, but hey you can be forgiven for not handling all the cases that other folks /may/ want or inlining more code than usual. The goal is to bend your editor a little, not write an Emacs package.

** Org web tools package

I showed how to write your own DWIM command, so you can make Emacs do what ✨you✨ mean. /ar/org-insert-link-dwim/ was built for my particular needs.

Having said all of this, alphapapa has built a great package with helpers for the org web/link space. It doesn't do what I mean (for now anyway), but it may work for you: [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-web-tools][org-web-tools: View, capture, and archive Web pages in Org-mode]][fn:1].

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 95% :height 95%
[[file:images/emacs-link-scraping-2021-edition/scrape.png]]

A recent Hacker News post, [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27302195][Ask HN: Favorite Blogs by Individuals]], led me to dust off my oldie but trusty [[https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/92ef8259f016cdd4f67caf0e520096f6da4f7a18/emacs/ar/ar-url.el#L42][command to extract comment links]]. I use it to dissect these wonderful references more effectively.

You see, I wrote this command [[https://xenodium.com/get-emacs-to-gather-links-in-posts/][back in 2015]]. We can likely revisit and improve. The [[https://github.com/zweifisch/enlive][enlive]] package continues to do a fine job [[https://github.com/zweifisch/enlive/blob/604a8ca272b6889f114e2b5a13adb5b1dc4bae86/enlive.el#L39][fetching]], parsing, and [[https://github.com/zweifisch/enlive/blob/604a8ca272b6889f114e2b5a13adb5b1dc4bae86/enlive.el#L142][querying]] HTML. Let's improve my code instead... we can shed a few redundant bits and maybe use [[https://xenodium.com/modern-elisp-libraries/][newer libraries and features]].

Most importantly, let's improve the user experience by sanitizing and filtering URLs a little better.

We start by writing a function that looks for a URL in the clipboard and subsequently fetches, parses, and extracts all links found in the target page.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'enlive)
  (require 'seq)

  (defun ar/scrape-links-from-clipboard-url ()
    "Scrape links from clipboard URL and return as a list. Fails if no URL in clipboard."
    (unless (string-prefix-p "http" (current-kill 0))
      (user-error "no URL in clipboard"))
    (thread-last (enlive-query-all (enlive-fetch (current-kill 0)) [a])
      (mapcar (lambda (element)
                (string-remove-suffix "/" (enlive-attr element 'href))))
      (seq-filter (lambda (link)
                    (string-prefix-p "http" link)))
      (seq-uniq)
      (seq-sort (lambda (l1 l2)
                  (string-lessp (replace-regexp-in-string "^http\\(s\\)*://" "" l1)
                                (replace-regexp-in-string "^http\\(s\\)*://" "" l2))))))
#+end_src

Let's chat /(current-kill 0)/ for a sec. No improvement from my previous usage, but let's just say building interactive commands that work with your current clipboard (or [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Kill-Ring.html][kill ring]] in Emacs terminology) is super handy (see [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-clone-git-repo-from-clipboard/][clone git repo from clipboard]]).

Moving on to sanitizing and filtering URLs... Links often have trailing slashes. Let's flush them. [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/3af9e84ff59811734dcbb5d55e04e1fdb7051e77/lisp/emacs-lisp/subr-x.el#L261][string-remove-suffix]] to the rescue. This and other handy string-manipulating functions are built into Emacs since 24.4 as part of [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/emacs-lisp/subr-x.el][subr-x.el]].

Next, we can keep http(s) links and ditch everything else. The end-goal is to extract links posted by users, so these are typically fully qualified external URLs. [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/3af9e84ff59811734dcbb5d55e04e1fdb7051e77/lisp/emacs-lisp/seq.el][seq-filter]] steps up to the task, included in Emacs since 25.1 as part of the [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/emacs-lisp/seq.el][seq.el family]]. We remove duplicate links using [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/3af9e84ff59811734dcbb5d55e04e1fdb7051e77/lisp/emacs-lisp/seq.el#L431][seq-uniq]] and sort them via [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/3af9e84ff59811734dcbb5d55e04e1fdb7051e77/lisp/emacs-lisp/seq.el#L255][seq-sort]]. All part of the same package.

When sorting, we could straight up use /seq-sort/ and /string-lessp/ and nothing else, but it would separate http and https links. Let's not do that, so we drop /http(s)/ prior to comparing strings in /seq-sort/'s predicate. [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/3af9e84ff59811734dcbb5d55e04e1fdb7051e77/lisp/subr.el#L4468][replace-regexp-in-string]] does the job here, but if you'd like to skip regular expressions, [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/3af9e84ff59811734dcbb5d55e04e1fdb7051e77/lisp/emacs-lisp/subr-x.el#L255][string-remove-prefix]] works just as well.

Yay, sorting no longer cares about http vs https:

#+begin_src
  https://andymatuschak.org
  http://antirez.com
  https://apenwarr.ca/log
  ...
#+end_src

With all that in mind, let's flatten list processing using [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/3af9e84ff59811734dcbb5d55e04e1fdb7051e77/lisp/emacs-lisp/subr-x.el#L69][thread-last]]. This isn't strictly necessary, but since this is the 2021 edition, we'll throw in this macro added to Emacs in 2016 as part of 25.1. Arthur Malabarba has a [[https://endlessparentheses.com/new-in-emacs-25-1-more-flow-control-macros.html][great post on thread-last]].

Now that we've built out /ar/scrape-links-from-clipboard-url/ function, let's make its content consumable!

** The completing frameworks way
This is the 2021 edition, so power up your completion framework du jour and feed the output of /ar/scrape-links-from-clipboard-url/ to our completion robots...

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 95% :height 95%
[[file:images/emacs-link-scraping-2021-edition/scrape_complete.gif]]

I'm heavily vested in [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]], but since we're using the built-in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Completion.html][completing-read]] function, any completion framework like [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][vertico]], [[https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum/][selectrum]], [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]], or [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ido/index.html][ido]] should kick right in to give you extra powers.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ar/view-completing-links-at-clipboard-url ()
    "Scrape links from clipboard URL and open all in external browser."
    (interactive)
    (browse-url (completing-read "links: "
                                 (ar/scrape-links-from-clipboard-url))))
#+end_src

** The auto-open way (use with caution)

Sometimes you just want to open every link posted in the comments and use your browser to discard, closing tabs as needed. The recent HN news instance wasn't one of these cases, with a whopping 398 links returned by our /ar/scrape-links-from-clipboard-url/.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 95% :height 95%
[[file:images/emacs-link-scraping-2021-edition/scrape_browse.gif]]

/Note: I capped the results to 5 in this gif/demo to prevent a Firefox tragedy (see [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/3af9e84ff59811734dcbb5d55e04e1fdb7051e77/lisp/emacs-lisp/seq.el#L231][seq-take]])./

In a case like Hacker News's, we don't want to surprise-attack the user and bomb their browser by opening a gazillion tabs, so let's give a little heads-up using [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/3af9e84ff59811734dcbb5d55e04e1fdb7051e77/lisp/subr.el#L2869][y-or-n-p]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ar/browse-links-at-clipboard-url ()
    (interactive)
    (let ((links (ar/scrape-links-from-clipboard-url)))
      (when (y-or-n-p (format "Open all %d links? " (length links)))
        (mapc (lambda (link)
                (browse-url link))
              links))))
#+end_src

** The org way

My [[https://xenodium.com/get-emacs-to-gather-links-in-posts/][2015 solution]] leveraged an [[https://orgmode.org/][org mode]] buffer to dump the fetched links. The org way is still my favorite. You can use whatever existing Emacs super powers you already have on top of the org buffer, including searching and filtering fueled by your favourite completion framework. I'm a fan of [[https://oremacs.com/][Oleh]]'s [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][swiper]].

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 95% :height 95%
[[file:images/emacs-link-scraping-2021-edition/scrape_org.gif]]

The 2021 implementation is mostly a tidy-up, removing some cruft, but also uses our new /ar/scrape-links-from-clipboard-url/ function to filter and sort accordingly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'org)

  (defun ar/view-links-at-clipboard-url ()
    "Scrape links from clipboard URL and dump to an org buffer."
    (interactive)
    (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create "*links*")
      (org-mode)
      (erase-buffer)
      (mapc (lambda (link)
              (insert (org-make-link-string link) "\n"))
            (ar/scrape-links-from-clipboard-url))
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (switch-to-buffer (current-buffer))))
#+end_src

** Emacs + community + packages + your own glue = awesome

To power our 2021 link scraper, we've used newer libraries included in more recent versions of Emacs, leveraged an older but solid HTML-parsing package, pulled in org mode (the epicenter of Emacs note-taking), dragged in our favorite completion framework, and tickled our handy browser all by smothering the lot with some elisp glue to make Emacs do exactly what we want.

Ray Oei's Stack Overflow [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/66234166][answer]] solved the mystery for me: pinentry never got invoked, so likely something's up with the agent... Killing (and thus restaring) the gpg-agent did the trick:

[[file:images/emacs-plus-with-native-comp/brew-native-comp.png]]

I'm a big fan of [[https://d12frosted.io/][Boris Buliga]]'s [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][Emacs Plus]] [[https://brew.sh/][homebrew]] recipe for customizing and installing Emacs builds on macOS.

For a little while, I took a detour and built Emacs myself, so I could enable [[https://twitter.com/Koral_001][Andrea Corallo]]'s fantastic [[http://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html][native compilation]]. I documented the steps [[https://xenodium.com/trying-out-gccemacs-on-macos/][here]]. Though it was fairly straightforward, I did miss Emacs Plus's convenience.

I had been meaning to check back on Emacs Plus for native compilation support. Turns out, it was merged back in [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/pull/188][Dec 2020]], and it works great!

Enabling native compilation is simple (just use /--with-native-comp/). As a bonus, you get all the Emacs Plus goodies. I'm loving /--with-elrumo2-icon/, enabling a spiffy icon to go with macOS Big Sur. /--with-no-frame-refocus/ is also handy to [[https://xenodium.com/no-emacs-frame-refocus-on-macos/][avoid refocusing other frames]] when another one is closed.

In any case, here's the minimum needed to install Emacs Plus with native compilation support enabled:

#+begin_src sh
  brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
  brew install emacs-plus@28 --with-native-comp
#+end_src

Sit tight. Homebrew will build and install some chunky dependencies (including gcc and libgccjit).

Note: Your init.el needs tweaking to take advantage of native compilation. See my [[https://xenodium.com/trying-out-gccemacs-on-macos/][previous post]] for how I set mine, or go straight to [[https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/features/fe-package-extensions.el#L19][my config]].

     leftFrame.y = leftFrame.y + 15
     leftFrame.w = leftFrame.w - 250

     rightFrame.w = 250 - 15 - 15
     rightFrame.h = rightFrame.h - 30

     -- Make space on right
     if win:frame() == maximizedFrame then

** org import (import vs in-place)

We can now import org files from the menu. Importing gives ya the option to either import (copy into the app) or open in-place. The latter enables users to sync org files with other iOS apps or just open/edit from Emacs for the full org-mode/agenda experience.

Syncing with your desktop can be achieved by either iCloud or by enabling other providers in the Files app (after installing the likes of Google Drive, Dropbox, etc).

/Please note that importing (copying into the app) is currently the recommended flow./ Opening in-place and syncing is still fairly experimental, so please back up your org files regularly. If you do run into syncing issues, please get in touch.

Good luck with your habits!

/No friction. No social. No analytics. No account. No cloud. No lock-in./

** So what is it?

An iOS app to help you form and track lasting habits.

** Why an app?

Tracking and accountability may help you develop positive habits. A simple habit-tracking app should make this easy. I'm not a habits expert, but got inspired by James Clear's [[https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits][Atomic Habits]]. Read that book if you're interested in the topic.

I wanted a frictionless habit tracker that gets out of the way, so I built one to my taste.

** Sounds like a lot of work?

You mean habit tracking? It's not. I tried to make the app simple and focused. Mark a habit done whenever you do it. It's really encouraging to see your daily streaks grow. I really don't want to break them.

** What kind of habits?

Any recurring habit you'd like to form like exercise, water the plants, read, make your bed, recycle, call grandma, yoga, cleaning, drink water, meditate, take a nap, make your lunch, journal, laundry, push-ups, sort out the dryer filter, floz, take your vitamins, take your meds, eat salad, eat fruit, practice a language, practice an instrument, go to bed early...

** So it's like a task/todo app?

Nope. This app focuses solely on habits. Unlike todos/tasks, habits must happen regularly. If you don't water the plants, they will die. If you don't exercise regularly, you won't get the health benefits. Keep your habits separate from that long list of todos. You know, that panic-inducing list you're too afraid to look at.

** Where is my data stored?

On your iPhone as a plain text file (in [[https://orgmode.org/][org mode]] format). You can view, edit, or migrate your data at any time (use export from the menu). You may also save it to a shared location, so you can access it from multiple devices/apps. Some of us like to [[http://xenodium.com/frictionless-org-habits-on-ios/][use our beloved text editors]] (Emacs, Vim, VSCode, etc.) to poke at [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Tracking-your-habits.html][habits]].

** Got more questions?

I may not have the answer, but I can try. Ping me at /flathabits*at*xenodium.com/.

** Privacy policy
No personal data is sent to any server, as there is no server component to this app. There are neither third party integrations, accounts, analytics, nor trackers in this app. All your data is kept on your iPhone, unless you choose a cloud provider to sync or store your data.

I've been wanting org to keep track of my daily habits for a little while. The catalyst: reading James Clear's wonderful [[https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits][Atomic Habits]] (along with plenty of lock-down inspiration).

As much as I live in Emacs and org mode, it just wasn't practical enough to rely on my laptop for tracking habits. I wanted less friction, so I've been experimenting with building a toy app for my needs. Naturally, org support was a strict requirement, so I could always poke at it from my beloved editor.

I've been using the app every day with success. The habits seem to be sticking, but equally important, it's been really fun to join the fabulous world of Emacs/Org with iOS/SwiftUI.

This is all very experimental[fn:1] and as mentioned on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ljurwx/org_habits_ios_app_want_to_try_it/][reddit]] (follow-up [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/lp62vn/org_habits_ios_app_followup_twoway_edit/][here]]) and [[https://twitter.com/xenodium/status/1361034010047176705][twitter]], the app isn't available on the App Store. I may consider publishing if there's enough interest, but in the mean time, you can reach out and install via [[https://testflight.apple.com/][TestFlight]].

Send me an email address to /flathabits*at*xenodium.com/ for a TestFlight invite.

[fn:1] The app's been fairly stable, but who knows... please backup your org file before feeding it to the lion.

** 2021-03-12 Update: Now with iOS Files app/sync integration

If you can sync your org file with your iPhone (ie. Drive/Dropbox/iCloud), and list it in the Files app, you should be able to open/edit[fn:1] with /Flat Habits/ (that's the name now). With iOS Files integration, you should be able to sync your habits between your iPhone and your [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][funky editor]] powering org mode[fn:2].

  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: swift-package-code-coverage
  :END:
While playing around with Swift package manager, I had a quick look into code coverage options. Luckily, coverage reporting and exporting are supported out of the box (via [[https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-cov.html][llvm-cov]]).

Ensure tests are invoked as follows:

#+begin_src sh
  swift test --enable-code-coverage
#+end_src

A high level report can be generated with:

#+begin_src bash :results verbatim
  xcrun llvm-cov report .build/x86_64-apple-macosx/debug/FooPackageTests.xctest/Contents/MacOS/FooPackageTests \
        -instr-profile=.build/x86_64-apple-macosx/debug/codecov/default.profdata -ignore-filename-regex=".build|Tests"
#+end_src

llvm-cov can export as lcov format:

#+begin_src sh
  xcrun llvm-cov export -format="lcov" .build/x86_64-apple-macosx/debug/FooPackageTests.xctest/Contents/MacOS/FooPackageTests -instr-profile=.build/x86_64-apple-macosx/debug/codecov/default.profdata -ignore-filename-regex=".build|Tests" > coverage.lcov
#+end_src

With the report in lcov format, we can look for an Emacs package to visualize coverage in source files. Found [[https://github.com/twada/coverlay.el][coverlay.el]] to require minimal setup. I was interested in highlighting only untested areas, so I set /tested-line-background-color/
 to nil:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package coverlay
    :ensure t
    :config
    (setq coverlay:tested-line-background-color nil))
#+end_src

After installing coverlay, I enabled the minor mode via /M-x coverlay-minor-mode/, invoked /M-x coverlay-watch-file/ to watch /coverage.lcov/ for changes, and voilà!

  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: emacs-rotate-my-macos-display
  :END:
Every so often, I rotate my monitor (vertical vs horizontal) for either work or to watch a movie. macOS enables changing the display rotation via a dropdown menu (under /Preferences > Displays > Rotation/) where you can pick between /Standard/, /90°/, /180°/, and /270°/. That's all fine, but what I'd really like is a quick way to toggle between my preferred two choices: /Standard/ and /270°/.

Unsurprisingly, I'd also like to invoke it as an interactive command via Emacs's /M-x/ (see [[http://xenodium.com/emacs-connect-my-bluetooth-speaker/index.html][Emacs: connect my Bluetooth speaker]]). With narrowing frameworks like [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]], [[https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/][helm]], and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/ido.html][ido]], invoking these commands is just a breeze.

Turns out, this was pretty simple to accomplish, thanks to Eric Nitardy's [[https://github.com/CdLbB/fb-rotate][fb-rotate]] command line utility. All that's left to do is wrap it in a tiny elisp +function+ hack, add the toggling logic, and voilà!

  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: emacs-clone-git-repo-from-clipboard
  :END:
Cloning git repositories is a pretty common task. For me, it typically goes something like:

- Copy git repo URL from browser.
- Drop to Emacs eshell.
- Change current directory.
- Type "git clone ".
- Paste git repo URL.
- Run git command.
- Change directory to cloned repo.
- Open dired.

No biggie, but why go through the same steps every time? We can do better. We have a hyper malleable editor, so let's get it to grab the URL from clipboard and do its thing.

/shell-command/ or /async-shell-command/ can help in this space, but require additional work: change location, re-type command, what if directory already exists... This is Emacs, so we can craft the exact experience we want. I did take inspiration from /shell-command/ to display the process buffer correctly (git progress, control codes, etc.) and landed on the following experience:

  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: emacs-chaining-org-babel-blocks
  :END:
Recently wanted to chain org babel blocks. That is, aggregate separate source blocks and execute as one combined block.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/emacs-chaining-org-babel-blocks/chain.gif]]

I wanted the chaining primarily driven through header arguments as follows:

#+begin_src org
  ,#+name: block-0
  ,#+begin_src swift
    print("hello 0")
  ,#+end_src

  ,#+name: block-1
  ,#+begin_src swift :include block-0
    print("hello 1")
  ,#+end_src

  ,#+RESULTS: block-1
  : hello 0
  : hello 1
#+end_src

I didn't find the above syntax and behaviour supported out of the box (or didn't search hard enough?). Fortunately, this is our beloved and malleable editor, so we can always bend it our way! Wasn't quite sure how to go about it, so I looked at other babel packages for inspiration. [[https://github.com/astahlman/ob-async][ob-async]] was great for that.

Turns out, advicing /org-babel-execute-src-block/ did the job:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun adviced:org-babel-execute-src-block (&optional orig-fun arg info params)
    (let ((body (nth 1 info))
          (include (assoc :include (nth 2 info)))
          (named-blocks (org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer)
                            'src-block (lambda (item)
                                         (when (org-element-property :name item)
                                           (cons (org-element-property :name item)
                                                 item))))))
      (while include
        (unless (cdr include)
          (user-error ":include without value" (cdr include)))
        (unless (assoc (cdr include) named-blocks)
          (user-error "source block \"%s\" not found" (cdr include)))
        (setq body (concat (org-element-property :value (cdr (assoc (cdr include) named-blocks)))
                           body))
        (setf (nth 1 info) body)
        (setq include (assoc :include
                             (org-babel-parse-header-arguments
                              (org-element-property :parameters (cdr (assoc (cdr include) named-blocks)))))))
      (funcall orig-fun arg info params)))

  (advice-add 'org-babel-execute-src-block :around 'adviced:org-babel-execute-src-block)
#+end_src

Before I built my own support, I did find that [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Noweb-Reference-Syntax.html][noweb]] got me most of what I needed, but required sprinkling blocks with placeholder references.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%

Combining [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Noweb-Reference-Syntax.html][:noweb]] and [[https://org-babel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/header-args/#prologue][:prologue]] would have been a great match, if only prologue did expand the noweb reference. I'm sure there's an alternative I'm missing. Either way, it was fun to poke at babel blocks and build my own chaining support.

* [2020-10-18 Sun] Emacs: org block complete and edit
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: emacs-edit-after-org-block-completion
  :END:
I quickly got used to [[http://xenodium.com/emacs-org-block-company-completion/][Emacs org block company completion]]. I did, however, almost always found myself running /org-edit-special/ immediately after inserting completion. I use *C-c '* for that. That's all fine, but it just felt redundant.

Why not automatically edit the source block in corresponding major mode after completion? I think I can also get used to that!

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/emacs-edit-after-org-block-completion/automatic.gif]]

Or maybe the automatic approach is too eager? There's also a middle ground: ask immediately after.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/emacs-edit-after-org-block-completion/prompted.gif]]

Or maybe I don't want either in the end? Time will tell, but I now have all three options available:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defcustom company-org-block-edit-mode 'auto
    "Customize whether edit mode, post completion was inserted."
    :type '(choice
            (const :tag "nil: no edit after insertion" nil)
            (const :tag "prompt: ask before edit" prompt)
            (const :tag "auto edit, no prompt" auto)))
#+end_src

The new option is now in the [[https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/ar/company-org-block.el][company-org-block snippet]] with my latest config.

* [2020-10-11 Sun] Emacs: create a Swift package/project
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: emacs-create-a-swift-packageproject
  :END:
Been playing around with [[https://swift.org/package-manager/][Swift Package Manager (SPM)]]. Creating a new Swift package (ie. project) is pretty simple.

To create a library package, we can use the following:

#+begin_src sh
  swift package init --type library
#+end_src

Alternatively, to create a command-line utility use:

#+begin_src sh
  swift package init --type executable
#+end_src

Turns out, there are a few options: empty, library, executable, system-module, manifest.

With a little elisp, we can write a completing function to quickly generate a Swift package/project without the need to drop to the shell.

Bonus: I won't have to look up SPM options if I ever forget them.

* [2020-10-04 Sun] Improved Ctrl-p/Ctrl-n macOS movement
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: improved-ctrl-p-ctrl-n-macos-movement
  :END:
macOS supports many Emacs bindings (out of the box). You can, for example, press C-p and C-n to move the cursor up and down (whether editing text in Emacs or any other macOS app). Jacob Rus's [[http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/site/cocoa-text.html][Customizing the Cocoa Text System]] offers a more in-depth picture and also shows how to customize global macOS keybindings (via DefaultKeyBinding.dict).

In addition to moving Emacs [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Point.html][point]] (cursor) up/down using C-p/C-n, I've internalized the same bindings to select an option from a list. Good Emacs examples of these are [[https://company-mode.github.io/][company mode]] and [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]].

Vertical cursor movement using Emacs bindings works well in most macOS apps, including forms and text boxes in web pages. However, selecting from a completion list doesn't quite work as expected. Although the binding is technically handled, it moves the cursor within the text widget, ignoring the suggested choices.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/improved-ctrl-p-ctrl-n-macos-movement/bindings-borked.gif]]

Atif Afzal's [[https://www.atfzl.com/use-emacs-key-bindings-everywhere][Use emacs key bindings everywhere]] has a solution for the ignored case. He uses [[https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements][Karabiner Elements]] to remap c-p and c-n to arrow-up and arrow-down.

It's been roughly a week since I started using the Karabiner remapping, and I've yet to find a case where a web page (or any other macOS app) did not respond to c-p and c-n to move selection from a list.

** Bonus (C-g to exit)

Pressing Esc often dismisses or cancels macOS windows, menus, etc. This is also the case for web pages. As an Emacs user, I'm pretty used to pressing C-g to cancel, quit, or exit things.

- 4 cups of milk [1]
- 3 tablespoons of honey [2]
- 1/4 teaspoon of crushed cardamom seeds [3]
- 1/8 teaspoon of salt

Simple. Combine all ingredients in a pot.

[1] Been using powder milk since lockdown, end-result's been tasty.
[2] Only tried raw honey so far.
[3] Can likely use ground cardamom. I enjoy the scents while crushing.

** Boil and simmer

Bring ingredients to a boil and simmer at low heat for 45 minutes. Stir occasionally.

** Mix in butter

- 1 tablespoon of butter.

Turn stove off, add a tablespoon of butter, and mix in.

Luckily, the hard work's already handled by [[https://github.com/hile/pytunes][pytunes]], a command line interface to macOS's iTunes/Music app. We add [[https://ffmpeg.org/ffprobe.html][ffprobe]] and some elisp glue to the mix, and we can generate an Emacs media index.

Indexing takes roughly a minute per 1000 files. Prolly suboptimal, but I don't intend to re-index frequently. For now, we can use a separate process to prevent Emacs from blocking, so we can get back to playing tetris from our beloved editor:

Once media is indexed, we can feed it to [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]] for that narrowing-down fuzzy-searching goodness! It's worth mentioning the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Size-of-Displayed-Text.html][truncate-string-to-width]] function. Super handy for truncating strings to a fixed width and visually organizing search results in columns.

#+end_src

The remaining bits are straigtforward. We add a few interactive functions to control playback:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun musica-info ()
    (interactive)
    (let ((raw (process-lines "pytunes" "info")))
      (message "%s [%s] %s"

               (string-trim (string-remove-prefix "Artist" (nth 1 raw)))
               (string-trim (string-remove-prefix "Album" (nth 2 raw))))))

  (defun musica-play-pause ()
    (interactive)
    (cl-assert (executable-find "pytunes") nil "pytunes not installed")
    (process-lines "pytunes" "play")
    (musica-info))

  (defun musica-play-next ()
    (interactive)
    (cl-assert (executable-find "pytunes") nil "pytunes not installed")
    (process-lines "pytunes" "next"))

  (defun musica-play-next-random ()
    (interactive)
    (cl-assert (executable-find "pytunes") nil "pytunes not installed")
    (process-lines "pytunes" "shuffle" "enable")
    (let-alist (seq-random-elt (musica--index))
      (process-lines "pytunes" "play" .filename))
    (musica-info))

  (defun musica-play-previous ()
    (interactive)
    (cl-assert (executable-find "pytunes") nil "pytunes not installed")
    (process-lines "pytunes" "previous"))
#+end_src

Finally, if we want some convenient keybindings, we can add something like:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c m SPC") #'musica-play-pause)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c m i") #'musica-info)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c m n") #'musica-play-next)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c m p") #'musica-play-previous)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c m r") #'musica-play-next-random)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c m s") #'musica-search)
#+end_src

Hooray! Controlling music is now an Emacs keybinding away: \o/

[[file:images/cheese-cake-recipe-no-crust/inoven.jpg]]

** Preheat oven

Preheat oven at 175°C.

** Ingredients at room temperature

Ensure the cream cheese, sour cream, and eggs are at room temperature before starting.

** Mix cream cheese

- 900g of cream cheese

Mix the cream cheese thoroughly.

** Mix sugar

- 240g of sugar

Add half the sugar. Mix in thoroughly. Add second half and mix.

** Mix sour cream, corn flour, and vanilla.

- 100g sour cream
- 40g corn flour
- 1tbsp vanilla bean paste

Add the three ingredients and mix well.

** Mix eggs

- 3 eggs
- 1 egg yolk

Add the eggs and mix for 30 seconds.

** Mix by hand

Finish mixing thoroughly by hand, using a wooden spoon.

** Prepare pan

- Springform pan
- Parchment paper

A springform pan works best here. Wrap its plate with parchment paper and lock it in place.

** Pour mix

- Strainer

Pour the mix through a strainer and into the prepared pan.

** Rest mix

Let the mix rest in the pan for 10 minutes to let air bubbles out.

** Bake

Bake for an 1 hour 10 minutes. Maybe add another 10 minutes (or more) if surface is still pale. Turn the oven off, leave door half open, and let it sit for 20 minutes.

** Cool off

Take out and let it cool off to room temperature.

** Refrigerate

Refrigerate for 4 hours (or overnight) before removing the sides of the pan.

** Eat!

Nom nom. Yum yum.

** Bonus (topping)

I winged this one and it worked out well. Heated up frozen berries with some honey and used it as topping. The whole combo was pretty tasty.

I took a look at the [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy/blob/060a4eb78ec8eba9c8fe3466c40a414d84b3dc81/snippets/python-mode/__init__][__init__ snippet]] from [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer][Jorgen Schäfer]]'s [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy][elpy]].

/UPDATE: I'm no longer using these steps. See [[https://xenodium.com/emacs-plus-with-native-comp/][Emacs plus --with-native-comp]] for an easier alternative./

Below are the instructions I use to build Andrea Corallo's [[http://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html][gccemacs]] on macOS. It is based on [[https://github.com/AllenDang][Allen Dang]]'s handy [[https://gist.github.com/AllenDang/f019593e65572a8e0aefc96058a2d23e][instructions]] plus some changes of my own.

** Install gcc and libgccjit via homebrew

#+begin_src sh
  brew install gcc libgccjit
#+end_src

** Save configure script

Create configure-gccemacs.sh

#+begin_src sh

  [[ -d $GCC_INCLUDE_DIR ]] ||  { echo "${GCC_INCLUDE_DIR} not found"; exit 1; }

  readonly GCC_LIB_DIR=${GCC_DIR}/lib/gcc/10
  [[ -d $GCC_LIB_DIR ]] ||  { echo "${GCC_LIB_DIR} not found"; exit 1; }

  export PATH="${SED_DIR}/libexec/gnubin:${PATH}"
  export CFLAGS="-O2 -I${GCC_INCLUDE_DIR}"
  export LDFLAGS="-L${GCC_LIB_DIR} -I${GCC_INCLUDE_DIR}"
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${GCC_LIB_DIR}"

  ./autogen.sh

  ./configure \

#+end_src

Make it executable

#+begin_src shell
  chmod +x configure-gccemacs.sh
#+end_src

** Clone Emacs source

#+begin_src shell
  git clone --branch master https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs gccemacs
#+end_src

** Configure build

#+begin_src sh
  cd gccemacs
  ../configure-gccemacs.sh
#+end_src

** Native lisp compiler found?

Verify native lisp compiler is found:

#+begin_src fundamental
  Does Emacs have native lisp compiler?                   yes
#+end_src

** Build

Put those cores to use. Find out how many you got with:

#+begin_src sh
  sysctl hw.logicalcpu
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: hw.logicalcpu: 4

Ok so build with:

#+begin_src sh
  make -j4 NATIVE_FAST_BOOT=1
  cp -r lisp nextstep/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/
  cp -r native-lisp nextstep/Emacs.app/Contents
  make install
#+end_src

*Note:* Using /NATIVE_FAST_BOOT=1/ significantly improves build time (totalling between 20-30 mins, depending on your specs). Without it, the build can take *hours*.

The macOS app build (under nextstep/Emacs.app) is ready, but read on before launching.

** Remove ~/emacs.d

You likely want to start with a clean install, byte-compiling all packages with the latest Emacs version. In any case, rename ~/emacs.d (for backup?) or remove ~/emacs.d.

** init.el config

Ensure /exec-path/ includes the script's "--prefix=" value, /LIBRARY_PATH/ points to gcc's lib dir, and finally set /comp-deferred-compilation/. I wrapped the snippet in my  /exec-path-from-shell/ config, but setting early in init.el should be enough.

You're good to go. Open Emacs.app via finder or shell:

** Deferred compilation logs

After setting /comp-deferred-compilation/ (in init.el config section), .elc files should be asyncronously compiled. Function definition should be updated to native compiled equivalent.

Look out for an **Async-native-compile-log** buffer. Should have content like:

#+begin_src fundamental
  Compiling .emacs.d/elpa/moody-20200514.1946/moody.el...
  Compiling .emacs.d/elpa/minions-20200522.1052/minions.el...

  Compiling .emacs.d/elpa/which-key-20200721.1927/which-key.el...
  ...
#+end_src

Can also check for .eln files:

#+begin_src sh
  find ~/.emacs.d -iname *.eln | wc -l
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 149

UPDATE1: Added /Symlink Emacs.app/Contents/eln-cache/ section for [[http://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html#org4b11ea1][update 11]].

UPDATE2: Noted using NATIVE_FAST_BOOT makes the build much faster.

UPDATE3: Removed symlinks and copied content instead. This simplifies things. Inspired by Ian Wahbe's [[https://github.com/iwahbe/doom-config/blob/master/build-emacs.sh][build-emacs.sh]].

UPDATE4: Removed homebrew recipe patching. Thanks to Dmitry Shishkin's [[https://github.com/shshkn/emacs.d/blob/master/docs/nativecomp.md][instructions]].

UPDATE5: Use new flag --with-native-compilation and master branch.
* [2020-08-02 Sun] SwiftUI macOS desk clock
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: swiftui-desk-clock
:END:

[[file:images/swiftui-desk-clock/everclock.gif]]

For time display, I've gone back and forth between an always-displayed macOS's menu bar to an auto-hide menu bar, and letting Emacs display the time. Neither felt great nor settled.

With some tweaks, Paul Hudson's [[https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-use-a-timer-with-swiftui][How to use a timer with SwiftUI]], led me to build a simple desk clock. Ok, let's not get fancy. It's really just an always-on-top floating window, showing a swiftUI label, but hey I like the minimalist feel ;)

Let's see if it sticks around or it gets in the way... Either way, here's standalone snippet. Run with /swift deskclock.swift/.

#+begin_src swift
  import Cocoa
  import SwiftUI

  let application = NSApplication.shared
  let appDelegate = AppDelegate()
  NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.regular)
  application.delegate = appDelegate
  application.mainMenu = NSMenu.makeMenu()
  application.run()

  struct ClockView: View {
    @State var time = "--:--"

    let timer = Timer.publish(every: 1, on: .main, in: .common).autoconnect()

              formatter.dateFormat = "HH:mm"
              time = formatter.string(from: input)
            }
            .font(.system(size: 40))
            .padding()
        }.frame(width: geometry.size.width, height: geometry.size.height)

      let initialMargin = CGFloat(60)
      let fallback = NSRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 150)

      guard let screenFrame = NSScreen.main?.frame else {
        return fallback
      }

      return NSRect(
        x: screenFrame.maxX - fallback.width - initialMargin,
        y: screenFrame.maxY - fallback.height - initialMargin,
        width: fallback.width, height: fallback.height)
    }
  }

  extension NSMenu {
    static func makeMenu() -> NSMenu {

[[https://twitter.com/twostraws][Paul Hudson]] authors excellent Swift material at [[https://www.hackingwithswift.com/][hackingwithswift.com]]. I regularly land on the site while searching for snippets from the browser. I was wondering if I could search for snippets directly from Emacs.

Turns out, hackingwithswift uses a JSON HTTP request for querying code examples. With this in mind, we can use /ivy-read/ like Oleh Krehel's [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/blob/8d840b2e8680e2768edb794c9ccecf975f6ba4cf/counsel.el#L6680][counsel-search]] and search for Swift snippets from our favorite editor:

✨ /UPDATE: The snippets in this post are outdated. See [[https://github.com/xenodium/ob-swiftui][ob-swiftui]] for better SwiftUI babel support/. ✨

Chris Eidhof [[https://twitter.com/chriseidhof/status/1261360332594974721][twitted]] a handy [[https://gist.github.com/chriseidhof/26768f0b63fa3cdf8b46821e099df5ff][snippet]] that enables quickly bootstrapping throwaway SwiftUI code. It can be easily integrated into other tools for rapid experimentation.

Being a SwiftUI noob, I could use some SwiftUI integration with my editor of choice. With some elisp glue and a small patch, Chris's snippet can be used to generate SwiftUI inline previews using Emacs org babel. This is particularly handy for playing around with SwiftUI layouts.

We can piggyback ride off zweifisch's [[https://github.com/zweifisch/ob-swift][ob-swift]] by advicing /org-babel-execute:swift/ to inject the org source block into the bootstrapping snippet. We also add a hook to /org-babel-after-execute-hook/ to automatically refresh the inline preview.

If you're a [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] user, the following snippet should make things fairly self-contained (if you have [[https://melpa.org/][melpa]] set up already).

/UPDATE: See [[https://github.com/xenodium/ob-swiftui][ob-swiftui]] for a better version of babel SwiftUI support./

Once the snippet is evaluated, we're ready to use in an org babel block. We introduced the /:swiftui/ header param to switch between inline static /preview/ and /interactive/ mode.

To try out an inline /preview/, create a new org file (eg. swiftui.org) and a source block like:

#+begin_src org :exports src
  ,#+begin_src swift :results file :swiftui preview
    VStack(spacing: 10) {
        HStack(spacing: 10) {
          Rectangle().fill(Color.yellow)
          Rectangle().fill(Color.green)
        }
        Rectangle().fill(Color.blue)
        HStack(spacing: 10) {
          Rectangle().fill(Color.green)
          Rectangle().fill(Color.yellow)
        }
      }
      .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)
  ,#+end_src
#+end_src

#+begin_src org :exports src
  ,#+results:
#+end_src
[[file:images/swiftui-layout-previews-using-emacs-org-blocks/vstack.jpg]]

Place the cursor anywhere inside the source block (#+begin_src/#+end_src) and press C-c C-c (or M-x org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c).

To run interactively, change the /:swiftui/ param to /interactive/ and press C-c C-c (or M-x org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c). When running interactively, press "q" (without ⌘) to quit the Swift app.

** Update

- Tweaked the snippet to make it more self-contained and made the steps more reproducible. Need to work out how to package things to make them more accessible. May be best to contribute as a patch to [[https://github.com/zweifisch/ob-swift][ob-swift]] and we can avoid the icky /advice-add/.
- Thanks to Chris Eidhof for PNG support (instead of TIFF). Also TIL Swift's /print/ has got a terminator param.

* [2020-05-22 Fri] Open Emacs elfeed links in the background
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: open-emacs-elfeed-links-in-background
  :END:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/open-emacs-elfeed-links-in-background/background-browse.gif]]

Christopher Wellons's [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][elfeed]] is a wonderful Emacs rss reader. In Mike Zamansky's [[https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-72-customizing-elfeed/][Using Emacs 72 - Customizing Elfeed]] video, he highlights a desire to open elfeed entries in the background. That is, open the current rss entry (or selected entries) without shifting focus from Emacs to your browser. This behaviour is somewhat analogous to ⌘-clicking/ctrl-clicking on multiple links in the browser without losing focus.

I've been wanting elfeed to open links in the background for some time. Zamansky's post was a great nudge to look into it. He points to the relevant [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed/blob/58ab1f8bcc3014206db42a7a26f3120ba5de4ca6/elfeed-search.el#L783][elfeed-search-browse-url]] function, re-implemented to suit his needs. In a similar spirit, I wrote a function to open the current rss entry (or selected entries) in the background.

I'm running macOS, so I took a look at [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/d714aa753b744c903d149a1f6c69262d958c313e/lisp/net/browse-url.el#L1018  I ][browse-url-default-macosx-browser]] to get an idea of how URLs are opened. Simple. It let's macOS handle it via the "open" command, invoked through /start process/. Looking at open's command-line options, we find /--background/ which "does not bring the application to the foreground."

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  open --background http://xenodium.com
#+end_src

"b" is already bound to /elfeed-search-browse-url/, so in our snippet we'll bind "B" to our new background function, giving us some flexibility:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package elfeed
    :ensure t
    :bind (:map elfeed-search-mode-map
                ("B" . ar/elfeed-search-browse-background-url))
    :config
    (defun ar/elfeed-search-browse-background-url ()
      "Open current `elfeed' entry (or region entries) in browser without losing focus."
      (interactive)
      (let ((entries (elfeed-search-selected)))
        (mapc (lambda (entry)
                (assert (memq system-type '(darwin)) t "open command is macOS only")
                (start-process (concat "open " (elfeed-entry-link entry))
                               nil "open" "--background" (elfeed-entry-link entry))
                (elfeed-untag entry 'unread)
                (elfeed-search-update-entry entry))
              entries)
        (unless (or elfeed-search-remain-on-entry (use-region-p))
          (forward-line)))))
#+end_src

Maybe xdg-open does a similar thing on linux (I've not looked). Ping me if you have a linux solution and I can update the function.

Happy Emacsing.

ps. I noticed elfeed uses /browse-url-generic/ if /elfeed-search-browse-url/'s is invoked with a prefix. Setting  [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/d0e2a341dd9a9a365fd311748df024ecb25b70ec/lisp/net/browse-url.el#L534][browse-url-generic-program]] and [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/d0e2a341dd9a9a365fd311748df024ecb25b70ec/lisp/net/browse-url.el#L539][browse-url-generic-args]] to use background options may be a more generic solution. For now, a custom function does the job.

* [2020-05-11 Mon] Enrich Emacs dired's batching toolbox
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: enrich-your-dired-batching-toolbox
  :END:
Shell one-liners are super handy for batch-processing files. Say you'd like to convert a bunch of images from HEIC to jpg, you could use something like:

#+begin_src sh
  for f in *.HEIC ; do convert "$f" "${f%.*}.jpg"; done
#+end_src

Save the one-liner (or memorize it) and pull it from your toolbox next time you need it. This is handy as it is, but [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][Emacs dired]] is just a file-management powerhouse. Its /dired-map-over-marks/ function is just a few elisp lines away from enabling all sorts of batch processing within your dired buffers.


Dired already enables selecting and deselecting files using all sorts of built-in mechanisms ([[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Marks-vs-Flags.html][dired-mark-files-regexp]], [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired-and-Find.html][find-name-dired]], etc) or wonderful third-party packages like Matus Goljer's [[https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks][dired-filters]].

Regardless of how you selected your files, here's a snippet to run ImageMagick's [[https://imagemagick.org/script/convert.php][convert]] on a bunch of selected files:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

            (kill-buffer (process-buffer process)))))
       (dired-map-over-marks (dired-get-filename) arg))))
#+end_src

The snippet can be shorter, but wouldn't be as friendly. We ask users to provide desired image format, spawn separate processes (avoids blocking Emacs), and generate a basic report. Also adds support for Windows.

[[file:images/enrich-your-dired-batching-toolbox/batch-dired.gif]]

** BEWARE

The snippet isn't currently capping the number of processes, but hey we can revise in the future...


** Update

Thanks to [[https://github.com/pbeliveau][Philippe Beliveau]] for pointing out a bug in snippet (now updated) and changes to make it Windows compatible.

Turns out with a little elisp glue, we can fuzzy search our Bluetooth devices and toggle connections. We can use [[https://twitter.com/_abo_abo][Oleh Krehel's]] [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy-read]] for fuzzy searching and [[https://twitter.com/lap_felix][Felix Lapalme]]'s nifty [[https://github.com/lapfelix/BluetoothConnector][BluetoothConnector]] to list devices and toggle Bluetooth connections.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: neapolitan-pizza-recipe
  :END:

  Full disclosure: I'm a complete noob at making pizza. It's my second pizza, but hey, it was tasty and fun to make! Making pizza at home is not as far-fetched as I initially thought.

** UPDATES:

I've made this recipe a couple of times. Made two improvements worth mentioning.

*** Flan tin / quiche pan

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/round_pie.jpg]]

My first pizzas were rectangular, matching the baking tray shape, but I really wanted round pies. I found a quiche pan at home and gave that a try. Worked pretty well. The dish bottom comes up, which is pretty handy.

*** Double baking

Bake in two stages:

1. Bake the pizza for 6 minutes (without the mozarella) at bottom of oven.
2. Add mozzarella and make for 4 minutes at top of the oven.

** Recipe

Ok, on to the recipe now...

*** Dissolve the yeast

- 7g of yeast.
- 325ml of lukewarm water.

Dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm water.

*** Mixing the dough

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/mix1.jpg]]
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/mix2.jpg]]

- 500g of flour.
- 1 teaspoon of salt.

Gradually add flour to the yeast and water mix, using the bottom of a spoon to work it until smooth (no lumps). The dough will be very sticky at first. Stay faithful to the spoon. It'll work. BBC's [[http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200415-how-to-make-pizza-like-a-neapolitan-master][How to make pizza like a Neapolitan master]] has a great demo. I followed the dough technique.

*** Kneading the dough

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/knead1.jpg]]

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/knead2.jpg]]

Sprinkle some flour on the table and knead the dough (punch, stretch, and fold many times) from previous step. Eventually, the dough will hold its shape.

*** Make 4 balls

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/cut_in_four.jpg]]

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/four_balls.jpg]]

Roll the dough into a cylinder and cut into 4 pieces. Make 4 balls.

*** Make the tomato sauce

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/garlic_slice.jpg]]

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/sauce_done.jpg]]

- 500g of passata.
- 3 cloves of garlic.

I love garlic. Who doesn't? Slice the garlic finely and combine with the passata in a class jar. Shake it a little. Garlic and passata. That's your sauce.

*** Cover for 2 hours

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/put_away.jpg]]

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/after_hours.jpg]]

Place the 4 dough balls into a container and cover with a damp cloth for 2 hours. You can make 4 pizzas.

/*Rookie mistake: I should have used a bigger container. The balls grew and merged./

*** Preheat oven

Preheat the oven at 250°C.

*** Stretch base

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/stretch.jpg]]

Sprinkle more flour on table prior to shaping the dough. Place ball on table, flatten. Flip over, flatten again. Gradually stretch until you have the shape and thickness desired.

*** Place base on baking tray

- Semolina
- Aluminium foil

Line up the tray with some aluminium foil. Before transferring the base on to the baking tray, sprinkle semolina (or breadcrumbs) on the foil (it helps prevent the dough from sticking).

*** Toppings

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/oiled.jpg]]

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/parmesan.jpg]]

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/mozarella.jpg]]

- Tomato sauce.
- Salt.
- Olive oil.
- Parmesan cheese.
- 125g of Mozzarella cheese.
- Fresh basil.

Spread some of the tomato sauce with a spoon. Sprinkle salt, olive oil, and parmesan cheese. Break the mozzarella into pieces and spread throughout. Add some basil leaves. Your basic margherita pizza is now ready for the oven.

*** Bake pizza

Place the tray in the oven for 10 minutes. This worked for my oven, which goes up to 250°C. Either way, keep an eye on it.

*** Post baking toppings

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/final.jpg]]

- Anchovies.

Controversial, but I really like anchovies. Add them post-baking and you're good to go. Enjoy your pizza.

I combined elements from two recipes: [[https://thefoodmedic.co.uk/2020/01/3-ingredient-oatmeal-cookies/][3 Ingredient oatmeal cookies (The Food Medic)]], Amy's [[https://amyshealthybaking.com/blog/2018/01/21/banana-oatmeal-raisin-cookies/][Healthy Banana Oatmeal Raisin Cookies (Amy's Healthy Baking)]] and added my own touches.

** Preheat oven

Preheat the oven at 180°C.

** Mash bananas

- 2 medium ripe bananas.

Mash until bananas have no significant lumps.

** Mix most ingredients (except oats)

- 4 tablespoons crunchy peanut butter.
- 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
- 1/2 teaspoon of ground cardamom.
- 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla.
- 1/3 cup raisins.

Add the peanut butter, cinnamon, cardamom, and vanilla into the mashed bananas. Mix well. Add raisins and mix a little further to spread them out.

** Add oats

- 1 3/4 cups of oats.

Add the oats to the mix in a few rounds to ensure its evenly mixed.

** Flattened balls in tray

Make balls, place on baking tray, and gently flatten. They'll be on the chunky side.

/Note: They won't spread as much as traditional cookies./

** Bake for 15 mins

Bake for about 15 minutes or until golden.

** Let cool off and enjoy

Wait a little and nom nom nom...

  :END:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/mumu4e-14-released/mu14.png]]

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/g3nsgg/mumu4e_14_has_been_released/][mu/mu4e 1.4 is out]]. About a week ago, I built and installed its [[https://github.com/djcb/mu/releases/tag/1.3.10][pre-release version (1.3.10)]] and noted [[http://xenodium.com/building-mumu4e-on-macos/][build steps on macOS]]. It's been working great for me. Today, I updated to 1.4.

I was keen to try the new release out. I had been experiencing a short delay immediately after syncing/indexing mail. An initial investigation pointed to contact syncing, but I didn't dig further. The 1.4 release notes had a promising entry:

#+begin_quote
  In many cases, `mu4e' used to receive /all/ contacts after each indexing operation; this was slow for some users, so we have updated this to /only/ get the contacts that have changed since the last round.
#+end_quote

After upgrading. The delay is gone for me \o/

*Note*: there are a few config tweaks needed for the 1.4 upgrade, but these are well-documented in the [[https://github.com/djcb/mu/releases/tag/1.4][release notes]]. For me, it primarily consisted of:

- Swapping elisp /mu4e-maildir/ var for /mu init --maildir path/to/local/IMAP/.
- Swapping elisp /mu4e-user-mail-address-list/ for /mu init --my-address address1@domain.com --my-address address2@domain.com/.
- Disabling /mu4e-maildirs-extension/ (not yet compatible with mu 1.4). No issues here, since I hardly ever look at the /mu4e-main/ buffer. I have global binding to my unread messages that looks a little something like this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun ar/mu4e-view-unread-messages ()
    (interactive)
    (mu4e-headers-search-bookmark (concat "flag:unread AND "

  :END:
I'm a fan of Magnar Sveen's [[https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el][multiple cursors]] Emacs implementation. It's just so fun to use and works very well with commands bound to my favorite keys.

Every now and then I'd like to execute extended commands on all cursors, but they have no keys bound to them. If you're an [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy/counsel]] fan like me (and all packages by [[https://oremacs.com/about/][Abo Abo]]), you use /counsel-M-x/ to invoke commands. However, /counsel-M-x/ doesn't support multiple cursors out of the box. Luckily, this is Emacs and we can fix that...

Back in December 2019, I made a note to revisit [[https://www.reddit.com/user/snippins1987/][u/snippins1987]]'s weekly tip to pair [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/eeyhdz/weekly_tipstricketc_thread/fch1bkv?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x][helm-M-x with multiple cursors]].

  :CUSTOM_ID: string-inflection-emacs-package
  :END:
  [[https://github.com/akicho8/string-inflection][string-inflection]] (by [[https://github.com/akicho8][Akira Ikeda]]) is a nifty package to cycle through string case styles: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles][camel, snake, kebab...]] The package includes a handful of cycling functions for different languages (Ruby, Python and Java), but it's easy to mix and match to roll your own. For now, I'm binding /C-M-j/ to /string-inflection-cycle/, which is an alias to /string-inflection-ruby-style-cycle/.

** Soak beans (overnight)

- 1 cup of rajmah (kidney beans).
- 2 cups of sabut urad (black lentils).

Place the beans in a bowl with plenty of water. The beans will soak it up so ensure there's enough.

** Cooking the beans

- 3 liters of water.
- 1 cinamon stick.
- 1 tablespoon of turmeric.
- 2 bay leaves.

Drain the beans and combine new ingredients into a pot. Bring to a boil and simer for 1.5 hours. Check beans aren't firm (give 'em a try'). If so extend another 15-30 mins.

** Prepare paste

- 1 4 cm piece of ginger.
- 1 large onion.
- 6 garlic cloves.
- 2 tomatoes.

Put through blender (with choppin pulse) or food processor until you get a paste.

** Golden paste

- Paste.
- 3 tablespoons of butter.
- 1 tablespoon of cumin seeds.
- 1 tablespoon of coriander powder.
- 1 tablespoon of chilly powder (or less to make milder).
- 1 fresh red hot pepper (find one with medium heat level) chopped.
- 1 tablespoon of cumin powder.
- 1/4 cup of water.
- 3/4 tablespoon of salt.

Heat up the butter (medium heat) and brown the cumin seeds (maybe 30 seconds). Add the paste from previous step. Cook for about 4 minutes or until golden. Add the remaining ingredients in step (except water) and cook for another 30 seconds. Add the water and salt and mix to make more fluid and remove from heat.

** Tying it all together

- 1 tablespoon of panchpuram (cumin, fenugreek, mistard, and fennel seeds).
- 300 ml of double cream.

Combine the cooked beans, golden paste, and seeds. Simmer for about 15 minutes. Add the cream and cook for about 2 minutes. You are effectively done.

** Garnish (optional)

You can serve and optionally garnish with some chopped coriander. Recommended.

** Serve with

Basmati rice, rotis, buttered buns, or even corn tortillas (unorthodox, but hey).

* [2020-03-21 Sat] Modern Emacs lisp libraries
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: modern-elisp-libraries
  :END:
Quickly finding related built-in elisp functions (without prefixes) can sometimes take a little poking around.

Some modern and predictable built-in exceptions I now reach out to are:

- [[https://nicolas.petton.fr/ressources/emacsconf2015/][map.el]] for key/values, alists, hash-tables and arrays (built-in as of Emacs 25.1).
- [[https://nicolas.petton.fr/ressources/emacsconf2015/][seq.el]] for sequence manipulation functions (built-in as of Emacs 25.1).
- [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/emacs-lisp/subr-x.el][subr-x.el]] has a handful of string functions (built-in as of Emacs 24.4).
- [[https://endlessparentheses.com/new-on-elpa-and-in-emacs-25-1-let-alist.html][let-alist.el]] wonderful syntax for alists, great for json (built-in as of Emacs 25.1).

If you don't mind reaching out to third-party libs (you likely have some of these already installed), here are some modern, predictable, and well-documented ones that always get me out of trouble:

- [[https://github.com/magnars/s.el#functions][s.el]] string manipulation.
- [[https://github.com/rejeep/f.el][f.el]] file/path handling.
- [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el#functions][dash.el]] for lists.
- [[https://github.com/Wilfred/ht.el][ht.el]] for hashtables.
- [[https://github.com/alphapapa/ts.el][ts.el]] for date and time.

I'm happy with built-ins like map.el, seq.el, and let-alist.el. subr-x.el is also pretty nice, although not as full-featured as third-party s.el.

Am I missing out on other modern built-ins or third-party libraries?

UPDATE: Added a handful of newly discovered libraries plus [[https://twitter.com/dmartincy/status/1241444701754085383?s=20][suggestions by Daniel Martín]] (thanks!). Not tried any of these myself.

- [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/rtree.el][rtree.el]] binary tree that stores ranges (Built-in).
- [[https://github.com/emacsorphanage/ov][ov.el]] simple way to manipulate overlay.
- Toby Cubitt's [[http://www.dr-qubit.org/tags/computing-code-emacs.html][libraries]] (heap, overlays, queue, avl-tree, trie, dict-tree, etc).
- [[https://github.com/VincentToups/shadchen-el][shadchen.el]] pattern-matching.
- [[https://phillord.github.io/m-buffer-el][m-buffer.el]] buffers.
- [[https://github.com/tali713/esxml][esxml.el]] xml and html.

* [2020-03-20 Fri] Emacs smartparens auto-indent
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: emacs-smartparens-auto-indent
  :END:
While I do most editing in Emacs, I use Xcode every now and then. I like Xcode's pair matching (of brackets) combined with its auto-indent.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/emacs-smartparens-auto-indent/xcode_indent.gif]]

While the wonderful [[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens][smartparens]] gives Emacs pair-matching powers, it doesn't automatically indent between pairs (out of the box anyway).

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/emacs-smartparens-auto-indent/indent_bracket_before.gif]]

Luckily, smartparens does provide /sp-local-pair,/ which enables us to achieve a similar goal.

With a short snippet, we can autoindent between {}, [], and () when pressing return in-between.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun indent-between-pair (&rest _ignored)
    (newline)
    (indent-according-to-mode)
    (forward-line -1)
    (indent-according-to-mode))

  (sp-local-pair 'prog-mode "{" nil :post-handlers '((indent-between-pair "RET")))
  (sp-local-pair 'prog-mode "[" nil :post-handlers '((indent-between-pair "RET")))
  (sp-local-pair 'prog-mode "(" nil :post-handlers '((indent-between-pair "RET")))

My Honeywell CM927 thermostat's screen had been getting progressively worse over the last year. As of late, the screen was of little use.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/fixing-honeywell-cm927-dead-screens/before.png]]

A random search yielded the [[https://www.homeownershub.com/uk-diy/honeywell-cm927-lcd-screen-fail-common-1058940-.htm][Honeywell CM927 LCD screen fail - common?]] thread, with a promising comment by Phil:

#+begin_quote
  "Strip the unit and remove the circuit board (just a few plastic clips, no screws). Remove the LCD assembly from the circuit board (more plastic clips and an eight pin push connection). Removed the LCD unit from the clear plastic housing (more plastic clips). Finally heat up the plastic ribbon where it is stuck to the circuit board (hair dryer will do trick) and then firmly press it onto the circuit board... probably worth doing this several times; in effect you are remating the ribbon to the circuit board by softening the adhesive. Put it all back together and it should be working again."
#+end_quote

Phil's instructions were great. There's also a super handy [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4LxHn5Y_l4][video]] by [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3Dbv6X-_7fCfa4AvsxK_zw][El Tucan]], also [[https://www.homeownershub.com/uk-diy/honeywell-cm927-lcd-screen-fail-common-1058940-3.htm][linked by Stevie]].

** Success \o/

Heating up the plastic ribbon and pressing it onto the circuit board did the trick for me. Took a few tries for all segments to appear, but the screen is looking great again.

Thank you Internet strangers! :)

* [2019-12-17 Tue] Studying for Life in the UK test
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: studying-for-life-in-the-uk-test
  :END:

Today, I passed the [[https://www.gov.uk/life-in-the-uk-test][Life in the UK test]]. Wasn't quite sure how to study for it. During my commutes, I listened to the [[https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Life-in-the-UK-2019-Test-Contains-the-Official-Course-300-Practice-Questions-Audiobook/B07VD9SR3L][Life in the UK 2019 Test audio book]].

A friend recommended [[https://lifeintheuktestweb.co.uk][lifeintheuktestweb.co.uk]]. Overall, I found their practice tests very useful. Taking a bunch tests helped me internalize the material.

Took some notes along the way (mostly data with years attached) and dumped it into an [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Built_002din-Table-Editor.html#Built_002din-Table-Editor][org table]]. This helped me form a mental timeline.

*NOTE:* /These tables alone are *not* comprehensive enough to prepare for the exam. You'll need to know additional information without dates attached./

* [2019-11-24 Sun] Wizard zines comics in Emacs eshell
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: wizard-zines-comics-eshell-util
  :END:
Over at [[http://wizardzines.com][wizardzines.com]], [[https://jvns.ca][Julia Evans]] authors wonderful zines on topics like git, networking, linux, command-line utilities, and others. Some zines are paid. Some are free. No affiliation here, just a fan.

A little while ago, Julia [[https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1192304892435738624][tweeted]] about a utility she's building to view her original comics on similar topics. I instantly thought it'd be a fun tool to implement for Emacs [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html][eshell]].

Since then, I subscribed to [[https://wizardzines.com/saturday-comics/][wizardzines.com/saturday-comics]] and received a few comics (awk, tar, and bash tricks). I saved them locally (using topic name and dropping file extensions).

#+begin_src sh :exports both
  ls -1 ~/Downloads/wizardzines-comics/
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| awk  |
| bash |
| tar  |

By no means battle-tested, but here's an elisp snippet defining the /ecomic/ command. It displays inlined comics in the handy eshell.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'eshell)
  (require 'iimage)

  (defvar wizardzines-comics-path "~/Downloads/wizardzines-comics")

  (defun eshell/ecomic (&rest args)
    "Display command comic in ARGS.
  Note: ensure comic images live in `wizardzines-comics-path', named with
  command name and no extension."
    (eshell-eval-using-options
     "ecomic" args
     '((?h "help" nil nil "show this usage screen")
       :external "ecomic"
       :show-usage
       :usage "COMMAND

     (let* ((command (nth 0 (eshell-stringify-list (eshell-flatten-list args))))
            (image-fpath (concat (file-name-as-directory
                                  (expand-file-name wizardzines-comics-path))

  :END:
Following up from [[http://xenodium.com/enhanced-emacs-searching-with-counsel-switches][Enhanced Emacs searching with counsel switches]], rather than remembering [[https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher][silver searcher]] and [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]] switches, we can use [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][counsel's]] /ivy-initial-inputs-alist/ to set these up as default visible switches.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (push '(counsel-ag . "--file-search-regex '' -- ") ivy-initial-inputs-alist)
  (push '(counsel-rg . "--glob '**' -- ") ivy-initial-inputs-alist)

The default switches stay out of the way in typical searches, but can be easily modified to include (or exclude) results matching specific file /names/.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: enhanced-emacs-searching-with-counsel-switches
  :END:
The [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][counsel]] family of Emacs search commands are great for searching the filesystem. More specifically, /counsel-rg/, /counsel-ag/, and /counsel-pt/, which use the popular [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]], [[https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher][silver searcher]], and [[https://github.com/monochromegane/the_platinum_searcher][platinum searcher]] utilities.

counsel-rg is my default searcher. It returns results quickly, with live updates as I tweak the search query.

Up until recently, my queries typically matched text in files only. This works great, but every so often I wished I could amend the query to include (or exclude) results matching specific file /names/. Turns out, you can prepend the search query with additional switches using the "--" separator.

The switches are usually utility-specific, but if we wanted to keep results from file names matching a glob, we can prepend the ripgrep query with something like /"--glob Make* --"/ or the shorter version /"-g Make* --"/.

rg: -g Make* -- install

* [2019-11-10 Sun] Emacs org block company completion
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: emacs-org-block-company-completion
:END:
UPDATE: This is now available [[https://melpa.org/#/company-org-block][on melpa]].

Back in 2015, I bound the "<" key to a hydra for quickly inserting org blocks. The idea came from Oleg's post on [[https://oremacs.com/2015/03/07/hydra-org-templates/][org-mode block templates in Hydra]]. The suggested binding settled in my muscle memory without much effort.

Fast forward to Febrary 2019. I replaced the hydra with /[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Easy-templates.html][org-insert-structure-template]]/ when /org-try-structure-completion/ was removed from org mode. No biggie, as I kept the same binding to "<" and hardly noticed the change.

Since my primary use-case for easy templates is inserting [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Working-with-source-code.html][source blocks]], I was keen to expedite choosing the source language as well as inserting the source block itself.

Writing a small [[https://company-mode.github.io/][company mode]] completion backend fits my primary use-case pretty well.

* [2019-11-03 Sun] A more reusable Emacs shell-command history
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: more-reusable-emacs-shell-command-history
  :END:
[[https://twitter.com/camdez][Cameron Desautel]] has a great post on [[https://engineering.collbox.co/post/working-faster-in-emacs-by-reading-the-future/][Working Faster in Emacs by Reading the "Future"]], highlighting /M-n/'s usefulness for inserting minibuffer default values.

Invoking /M-n/ in /shell-command/'s prompt is handy for quickly getting the current buffer's file name. This works great for one-off shell commands like /"chmod +x script.sh"/ or /"tidy -xml -i -m data.xml"/. Unfortunately, these commands aren't easily reusable from /shell-command/'s minibuffer history, since it'll keep hardcoded file names.

There's likely existing built-in functionality or a more elaborate package for this, but advising /read-shell-command/ enables us to write more reusable commands like /"chmod +x $f"/ or /"tidy -xml -i -m $f"./ We merely replace /$f/ with /(buffer-file-name)/, and let everything else continue as usual.

                                        (user-error "No file file visited to replace $f"))

It's worth mentioning that searching minibuffer history is pretty simple when leveraging [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][counsel]] to fuzzy search (via /counsel-minibuffer-history/, bound to /C-r/ by default).

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/more-reusable-emacs-shell-command-history/richer-shell-command-history.gif]]

On a final note, searching minibuffer history for cache hits is way more useful with richer history content. Be sure to save minibuffer history across Emacs sessions and increase /shell-command-history/ using the built-in [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SaveHist][savehist-mode]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

Emacs [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][swiper]] is awesome. I bound /swiper-isearch/ to /C-s/. Also a big fan of [[https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el][multiple cursors]]. I use it regularly (it's fun).

I had totally missed Ole's post back in 2015: [[https://oremacs.com/2015/10/14/swiper-mc/][A simple multiple-cursors extension to swiper]]. Turns out, swiper has multiple cursors support out of the box (bound to /C-7/ by default). Yay!

UPDATE: Thanks to [[https://irreal.org/blog/?p=8370][irreal's post]], please remember to add /swiper-mc/ to /mc/cmds-to-run-once/ list (or things won't work as expected). This typically happens interactively when you invoke C-7 the first time around. Make sure you answer "n" when you see a prompt like:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/emacs-swiper-and-multiple-cursors/swiper-mc-no.png]]

If you happen to choose "y" by mistake, take a look at *~/.emacs.d/.mc-lists.el* to correct it. Remove /swiper-mc/ from /mc/cmds-to-run-for-all/
 and add it to /mc/cmds-to-run-once/. Invoke /m-x eval-buffer/ to reset the values and you're good to go.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: batch-renaming-with-counsel-find-dired-and-wdired
  :END:
The first time I saw [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Wdired.html][wdired]] in action, it blew my mind. wdired makes [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html#Dired][dired]] (directory editor) buffers writeable, so you can edit them like any other Emacs buffer. You can subsequently use all your favorite file-editing tricks to rename files (amongst other things). You can see it in action at the end of [[http://emacsrocks.com/e16.html][Emacs Rocks episode 16]].

When combining [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired-and-Find.html][find-dired]] with wdired, one can easily find matching files and quickly batch rename them using something like [[https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el][multiple cursors]] or [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Keyboard-Macros.html][keyboard macros]]. I've been a fan of the /find-dired/ -> /dired-toggle-read-only/ -> /mc/mark-all-like-this/ workflow for quite some time, but I always wished I could adjust /find-dired/ queries a little quicker by getting immediate feedback.

Completion frontends like [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]] and [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]] are perfect for getting this kind of immediate feedback. Peeking into ivy's [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/blob/master/counsel.el][counsel source]], I borrowed some ideas to glue counsel-style narrowing on a find command, which I can easily translate to a writeable dired buffer for all that joyful-mutiple-cursor-editing experience.

* [2019-04-16 Tue] Mark region, indent, restore location
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: mark-region-indent-restore-location
  :END:
When I'm not using an automatic code formatter (ie. clang-format, gofmt, etc.), I often find myself using Emacs region marking commands like /mark-defun/, /er/expand-region/, and /mark-whole-buffer/ prior to pressing <tab>, which is bound to /indent-for-tab-command/.

This is all working as expected: the selection gets indented and the point is left in the current location.

Say we have the following snippet we'd like to indent.

[[file:images/mark-region-indent-restore-location/before.png]]

Mark region with C-M-h (mark-defun)

[[file:images/mark-region-indent-restore-location/selection.png]]

Indent with <tab> (indent-for-tab-command)

[[file:images/mark-region-indent-restore-location/basic-indent.png]]

We're done. The selected function is now indented as expected.

But... I always wished the point returned to the location prior to initiating the region-marking command, in this case /mark-defun/.

In short, I wish the point had ended in the following location.

[[file:images/mark-region-indent-restore-location/smart-indent.png]]

I'm not aware of an existing package that helps with this, so here's a tiny minor mode (divert-mode) to help with restoring point location after indenting a region. The /diverted-events/ variable can be used to track specific region selecting commands and associate breadcrumb functions to replace the point location as needed.

  :END:
[[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Ivy]] is great. I've been meaning to figure out a way to swap sources while running ivy. This would enable me to cycle through different sources using the existing search parameters.

At first look, /'ivy-set-sources/ seemed like the right choice, but it's used during setup to agregate sources. Subsequent /'ivy-set-sources/ calls are ignored during an /'ivy-read/ session.

There's an ivy [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/issues/606][feature request]] over at github with a similar goal in mind. Although the feature is not yet supported, there's a handy suggestion to use /'ivy-quit-and-run/ to quit the current command and run a different one.

With /'ivy-quit-and-run/ in mind, we can write our /'ar/ivy-read/ function to take a list of sources and add a little logic to cycle through them using a keybiding, in my case <left> and <right>.

==> Caveats
Emacs.app was installed to:
  /Users/some-user/homebrew/Cellar/emacs-plus/26.1

To link the application to default Homebrew App location:
  brew linkapps
or:
  ln -s /Users/some-user/homebrew/Cellar/emacs-plus/26.1/Emacs.app /Applications

--natural-title-bar option was removed from this formula, in order to
  duplicate its effect add following line to your init.el file
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-transparent-titlebar . t))
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-appearance . dark))
or:
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-transparent-titlebar . t))
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-appearance . light))

If you are using macOS Mojave, please note that most of the experimental
options are forbidden on Mojave. This is temporary decision.


To have launchd start d12frosted/emacs-plus/emacs-plus now and restart at login:
  brew services start d12frosted/emacs-plus/emacs-plus
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  emacs

Late to the party, giving [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools][pdf-tools]] a try.

* [2018-12-25 Tue] Using OCR to create searchable pdfs from images
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: using-ocr-to-create-searchable-pdfs-from-images
  :END:
Used my phone to take a handful of photos of an article from a magazine. Wanted to convert the images to a searchable pdf on macOS.

This was straightforward, having [[http://xenodium.com/trying-out-tesseract][already installed tesseract]].

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  for i in IMG_3*.jpg; do echo $i; tesseract $i $(basename $i .tif) pdf; done
#+END_SRC

Should now have a handful of OCR'd pdfs:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results verbatim :exports both
  ls *.jpg.pdf
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: IMG_3104.jpg.pdf
: IMG_3105.jpg.pdf
: IMG_3106.jpg.pdf
: IMG_3107.jpg.pdf

Finally, join all pdfs into one. Turns out macOS has a handy python script already installed. We can use it as:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  /usr/bin/python "/System/Library/Automator/Combine PDF Pages.action/Contents/Resources/join.py" -o joined.pdf IMG_*pdf
#+END_SRC

ps. [[https://pdfgrep.org][pdfgrep]] is great for searching pdfs.

* [2018-12-25 Tue] Emailing pdfs to kindle from mu4e
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: emailing-pdfs-to-kindle-from-mu4e
  :END:
Wanted to send a pdf to my kindle for some holiday reading. You can easily do this by emailing the pdf to your kindle-bound email address.

Now, I typically attach files when composing mu4e emails by using /mml-attach-file/, which attaches the file using /<#part>...<#/part>/. However, the Amazon service did not find the attached pdf, so no pdf was added to my Kindle.

Fortunately, I found a handy [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/97abs7/anyone_uses_mu4e_to_send_mobi_files_to_kindle][Reddit thread, leding me to a working solution]]. Wrapping the part using /<#multipart type=mixed>...<#/multipart>/ did the job, using /mml-insert-multipart/, followed by /mml-attach-file/.

Resulting attachment should look something like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  <#multipart type=mixed>
  <#part type="application/pdf" filename="/path/to/file.pdf" disposition=attachment>
  <#/part>
  <#/multipart>
#+END_EXAMPLE

I should add a convenience elisp function for this, but that's for another time...

* [2018-12-08 Sat] DWIM ivy quit
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: dwim-ivy-quit
  :END:
"Do-what-I-mean" (DWIM) functions enable us to introduce new Emacs powers to existing workflows without incurring the typical cost of remembering multiple related functions or introducing yet another key binding. DWIM functions invoke other functions, based on current context.

I wanted a small tweak in Ivy's /`minibuffer-keyboard-quit'/ invocation, commonly invoked via /C-g/ key binding:

1. If we have text selected in minibuffer, deselect it.
2. If we have any text in minibuffer, clear it.
3. If no text in minibuffer, quit.

Added /`ar/ivy-keyboard-quit-dwim'/ for this purpose. Binding it to C-g in /ivy-minibuffer-map/:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package ivy
    :ensure t
    :bind (:map ivy-minibuffer-map
                ("C-g" . ar/ivy-keyboard-quit-dwim))
    :config
    (defun ar/ivy-keyboard-quit-dwim ()
      "If region active, deactivate. If there's content, clear the minibuffer. Otherwise quit."
      (interactive)
      (cond ((and delete-selection-mode (region-active-p))
             (setq deactivate-mark t))
            ((> (length ivy-text) 0)
             (delete-minibuffer-contents))

[[https://twitter.com/twostraws][Paul Hudson's]] [[https://twitter.com/twostraws][tweet]] introduced me to Swift's multiline string indentation control using closing quotes. Neat!

Being an org-mode fan, I thought I'd give Swift multiline strings a try using Org [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html][Babel's]] [[https://github.com/zweifisch/ob-swift][ob-swift]]. I get to verify it and document at the same time. Win.

Swift org mode source blocks (ie. BEGIN_SRC/END_SRC) can be added as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC org :exports src
  ,#+BEGIN_SRC swift :exports both
    print("""
         Hello World
    """)

    print("""
         Hello World
         """)
  ,#+END_SRC

  ,#+RESULTS:
  :      Hello World
  : Hello World
#+END_SRC

By pressing /C-c C-c/ anywhere in the code block, the snippet is executed and its output captured in the /RESULT/ block. Super handy for quickly trying out snippets and keeping as future reference.

As a bonus, the above blocks can be exported to HTML ([[https://orgmode.org/manual/Exporting.html][amongst other formats]]). With some [[https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/search?q=org-html-head-extra&unscoped_q=org-html-head-extra][styling]], it looks as follows:

  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: quickly-swapping-elfeed-filters
  :END:
I seem to be more efficient in getting through rss feeds by individually browsing through related content. That is, I can get through all Emacs entries a lot faster if I look at Emacs content exclusively, instead of mixing with say BBC news. [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][Elfeed]] filters are great for filtering related content.

I wanted a way to easily switch through my typical categories of related content by quickly changing elfeed filters using a completion framework.

Emacs's [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Minibuffer-Completion.html][completing-read]] plays nicely with your favorite completing framework (mine is [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]]). With a couple of functions, we can get Emacs to ask us for the filtering category using human-readable options and quickly presenting related content. Binding the new functionality to <tab> is working well for me.

It's been roughly 5 months since [[http://xenodium.com/#trying-out-mu4e-and-offlineimap][my mu4e email migration]]. Happy with my choice. [[http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][Mu4e]] is awesome.

I now have 4 email accounts managed by mu4e, and unfortunately receiving lots of junk mail.

I regularly peek at junk folders for false positives and delete junk email permanently. I've been wanting a quick way to glance at junk mail and easily delete page by page.

Deleting emails page by page is not supported in mu4e by default. /Fortunately, this is Emacs and we can change that™./

There's a handy package by Roland Walker called [[http://github.com/rolandwalker/window-end-visible][window-end-visible]]. We can use it to select mu4e emails by page and subsequently glue it all together to enable deleting emails by page.

* [2018-11-06 Tue] Working with vultr's ipv6-only instances
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: working-with-vultrs-ipv6-only-instances
  :END:
Having recently read [[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Transforming-Relationship-Achieving-Financial-Independence/dp/0143115766/][Your Money or Your Life]], I've been cutting down on personal expenses wherever possible. Specially recurring expenses which include monthly charges from VPS hosting. Let's reduce those charges...

My VPS needs are fairly small (mostly hobby and tinkering). [[https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7579034][Vultr]]† has a plan for $2.50/month (not seen anything cheaper). The caveat for the price, you get ipv6 access only (ie. 0000:1111:2222:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888).

So far so good, but my ISP doesn't yet support ipv6:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ping6 0000:1111:2222:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888
$ ping6: UDP connect: No route to host
#+END_SRC

Fortunately, we can still work with ipv6 by using a tunnel (TIL about [[https://tunnelbroker.net][Hurricane Electric's tunnel broker]]). After signing up and creating a tunnel, they conveniently show you "Example Configurations" from the "Tunnel Details" menu. In my case, macOS:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ifconfig gif0 create
  ifconfig gif0 tunnel <ipv4 client broker IP or DCHP internal IP> <ipv4 server IP>
  ifconfig gif0 inet6 <ipv6 client broker IP> <ipv6 server IP> prefixlen 128
  route -n add -inet6 default <ipv6 server IP>
#+END_SRC

Note: If behind router, use the DHCP internal IP.

After configuring with ifconfig, all is good. Yay!

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ ping6 0000:1111:2222:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888
  PING6(56=40+8+8 bytes) 2001:111:22:aaa::2 --> 0000:1111:2222:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888

  16 bytes from 0000:1111:2222:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888, icmp_seq=2 hlim=52 time=311.960 ms

#+END_SRC

I'm an ipv6 noob. I mostly need ssh access. My typical usages need small tweaks.

For ssh:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ssh -6 username@0000:1111:2222:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888
#+END_SRC

For scp:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  scp -6 file.txt username@\[0000:1111:2222:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888\]:/remote/dir/

* [2018-10-17 Wed] imenu on Emacs eshell
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: imenu-on-emacs-eshell
  :END:
  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Imenu.html][imenu]] navigation is one of those Emacs gems I didn't discover until much later on. It does what you'd expect in all types of modes. In rare instances, I've found specific modes missing imenu support. Fortunately, this is Emacs and you can fix that.

  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html][Eshell]] has a handy feature to jump back and forth over previous prompts using /M-x eshell-previous-prompt (C-c C-p)/ and /M-x eshell-next-prompt (C-c C-n)/. Upon learning about these two functions, my immediate reaction was to try imenu. Surprisingly, it didn't "just work\n", but a tiny bit of elisp brought balance back to the Emacs universe.

  In an eshell mode hook function, one can set the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Imenu.html#index-imenu_002dgeneric_002dexpression-2058][imenu-generic-expression]] to help it find your favorite prompt:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-local imenu-generic-expression
                    '(("Prompt" " $ \\(.*\\)" 1)))
#+END_SRC

  Ah it's the little things...

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/imenu-on-emacs-eshell/eshell-imenu.gif]]

ps. If wondering why my imenu experience looks a little different, that's because I'm using Abo Abo's wonderful [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][counsel]] and /M-x counsel-semantic-or-imenu/.

  :CUSTOM_ID: m-r-history-search-in-git-commit-mode
  :END:
I've grown accustomed to M-r bindings to search Emacs history. Been wanting similar functionality to search commit message history. Turns out /log-edit-comment-ring/ has some of my local commit message history. Feeding it to /completing-read/ gives me an easily searchable history when using a completing framework like ivy or helm:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun ar/git-commit-search-message-history ()
    "Search and insert commit message from history."
    (interactive)
    (insert (completing-read "History: "
                             ;; Remove unnecessary newlines from beginning and end.
                             (mapcar (lambda (text)
                                       (string-trim text))
                                     (ring-elements log-edit-comment-ring)))))
#+END_SRC

Now we bind it to /M-r/ and we're good to go:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (bind-key "M-r" #'ar/git-commit-search-message-history git-commit-mode-map)
#+END_SRC

May also want to persist /log-edit-comment-ring/ across Emacs sessions by adding /log-edit-comment-ring/ to savehist variables. Also ensure /savehist-mode/ is enabled:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'savehist-additional-variables log-edit-comment-ring)
  (savehist-mode +1)
#+END_SRC

  :End:
[[http://isync.sourceforge.net/][Mbsync]] and [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]] are great for syncing and handling IMAP email. I've now migrated 4 email addresses, including an old Yahoo account.

I wanted to mark all my Yahoo unread emails as read. Yahoo's webmail enables marking 500 emails at a time, making the process a little tedious.

[[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mu-discuss][Mu-discuss]] has a handy [[https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mu-discuss/zaA394sH1Ow/QSVPXS22BQAJ][thread]], highlighting that moving/renaming synced messages (in your local file system) would do the job. This worked well for me.

Let's do just that...

*WARNING:* Copy a small sample of your mails to a separate directory and run some trials until you feel comfortable.

Find your mail directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cd path/to/mail
#+END_SRC

Peek at the messages you'd like to mark unread:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ls -1 new/
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
  1529958027.57518_11.mbp,U=8415:2,

  1532464801.21057_2.mbp,U=9029:2,

Rename message files by appending "S" to their filename and moving from new/ to cur/ directory.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  for FILE in new/*; do mv "${FILE}" cur/$(basename "${FILE}")S; done;
#+END_SRC

We can verify the move.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ls -1 cur/
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
  1529958027.57518_11.mbp,U=8415:2,S

  1532464801.21057_2.mbp,U=9029:2,S

Let's sync the local changes.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mbsync -Va
#+END_SRC

...and we're done ;)

  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: fitbit-api-org-babel-and-gnuplot
  :END:
Retook running recently. Took the dust off my aria scale and used the opportunity to check out fitbit's API.

First register your app at [[https://dev.fitbit.com/apps/new][dev.fitbit.com/apps/new]] and get a client_id=AABBCC.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/fitbit-api-org-babel-and-gnuplot/fitbitapp.png]]

You'll also need your USER_ID, from your Fitbitx user profile.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/fitbit-api-org-babel-and-gnuplot/fitbituser.png]]

We'll also need a token. I used the [[https://dev.fitbit.com/build/reference/web-api/oauth2/][implicit grant flow]] URL in my browser and extracted access_token=TOKEN.

Now let's wire up two org source blocks to fetch the data and subsequently plot using gnuplot.

It's pretty neat. You can take the output from one source block and use it as input to another.

We use curl to fetch data from fitbit's API and pipe through [[https://stedolan.github.io/jq/][jq]] and sed to massage the output format into two columns.

*Note:* Before using gnuplot in org babel, you'll need to install the gnuplot package and add to babel languages.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package gnuplot :ensure t)

  (use-package ob
    :config
    (org-babel-do-load-languages
     'org-babel-load-languages

  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: emacs-utilities-for-your-os

Narrowing utilities are a wonderful way of increasing productivity. I have a few workflows using Emacs's [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]] framework.

There are great productivity boosters like [[https://www.alfredapp.com/][Alfred]] and [[https://qsapp.com/][Quicksilver]] for macOS, with batteries included.

If you're a tinkerer, you'd enjoy the powerful [[http://hammerspoon.org/][Hammerspoon]]. Like elisp gluing all things Emacs, Hammerspoon uses Lua to glue all things macOS. You can build your own narrowing utilities using [[http://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/hs.chooser.html][chooser]] and a little Lua.

#+BEGIN_SRC
  local chooser = hs.chooser.new(function(choice)
        hs.alert.show(choice['text'])
  end)

        {

           ["subText"] = "macOS only\n",

        {
           ["text"] = "Quicksilver\n",

           ["subText"] = "macOS only\n",
        },
        {
           ["text"] = "Emacs\n",

Howard Abrams's post on [[http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/capturing-content.html][Capturing Content for Emacs]] inspired me to look at gluing Emacs and macOS to launch my own cross-platform narrowing utilities.

I've also taken this opportunity to look at Oleh Krehel's wonderful completion package: [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Ivy]]. We can use it to build a macOS narrowing utility.

Ivy is remarkably easy to use. Turns out, [[http://oremacs.com/swiper/#api][ivy-read]] is all you need. A simple Emacs completion can be accomplished with little elisp.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (ivy-read "Hello ivy: "
            '("One "
              "Two "
              "Three "
              "Four "))
#+END_SRC

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%
[[file:images/emacs-utilities-for-your-os/simple_ivy.png]]

Pretty nifty. Let's make this completion more accessible from the rest of the OS. To do so, we create a separate Emacs frame and make it pretty. We also want it to interact with the OS. We'll use /ivy-read/'s /:action/ to invoke a tiny bit of AppleScript.

Oh and we'll also use some funny quotes to tease ourselves about our beloved editor.

So where's all this going? I wrote a utility to extract all links from [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenodium/xenodium.github.io/master/index.org][this page's org file]] and make them easily searchable from anywhere on macOS by invoking *⌥-W*.

The keys are bound using Lua, Hammerspoon, and emacsclient. This works well on macOS, but there are alternatives for other operating systems.

#+BEGIN_SRC
  hs.execute("emacsclient -ne \""..elisp.."\" -s /tmp/emacs*/server")
#+END_SRC

Here's the resulting utility in action:

These integrations look promising. They enable me to bring cross-platform Emacs utilities into areas I hadn't considered.

* [2018-06-17 Sun] Trying out mu4e with mbsync
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: trying-out-mu4e-with-mbsync
  :END:
The email fun in Emacs continues. After a few weeks since I [[#trying-out-mu4e-and-offlineimap][started using mu4e and offlineimap]], I'm sold. Both are awesome. [[http://isync.sourceforge.net/mbsync.html][Mbsync]] is an [[http://www.offlineimap.org/][offlineimap]] alternative. Despite resyncing all my mail, the transition was fairly smooth. Here's how...

** Install isync (for mbsync)

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install isync
#+END_SRC

** Configure mbsync

Mbsync uses ~~/.mbsyncrc~ for configuration. Migrating [[#trying-out-mu4e-and-offlineimap][~/.offlineimaprc]] to ~~/.mbsyncrc~ looks like:

#+BEGIN_SRC conf
  IMAPAccount Personal
  Host some.imap.host.com
  User your_user_name
  PassCmd "gpg --quiet --batch -d ~/.offlineimap_accountname.gpg"
  Port 993
  SSLType IMAPS
  AuthMechs Login
  CertificateFile  ~/.offlineimapcerts.pem
  # My IMAP provider doesn't handle concurrent IMAP commands.
  PipelineDepth 1

  IMAPStore Personal-remote
  Account Personal

  MaildirStore Personal-local
  Path ~/IMAP/Personal/
  Inbox ~/IMAP/Personal/INBOX

  Channel Personal
  Master :Personal-remote:
  Slave :Personal-local:
  Patterns *
  Create Slave
  Sync All
  Expunge Both
  SyncState *
#+END_SRC
** No concurrent IMAP commands supported

My IMAP provider doesn't handle concurrent IMAP commands. [[https://kdecherf.com/blog/2017/05/01/mbsync-and-office-365/][mbsync and Office 365]] had the answer:

#+BEGIN_SRC conf
  PipelineDepth 1
#+END_SRC

** Initial sync

Run initial from the command line sync:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mbsync -Va
#+END_SRC

While syncing my largest inbox, it sometimes received an unexpected EOF error:

#+BEGIN_SRC
  IMAP error: unexpected EOF from some.imap.host.com (1.2.3.4:993)
#+END_SRC

First few times, I restarted the syncing manually, but then used a loop to automatically restart it.

Bash loops:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  while true; do mbsync -V Personal; sleep 5; done
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  for i in {1..5}; do mbsync -V Personal; sleep 5; done
#+END_SRC

Eshell loop:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  for i in (number-sequence 1 10) {mbsync -V Personal; sleep 5}
#+END_SRC

** Create mu index

Reindex using mu, but first remove existing index for offlineimap messages:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  rm -rf ~/.mu
#+END_SRC

Ok, do index now:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  mu index --maildir=~/IMAP
#+END_SRC

** Mu4e tweaks

The /get mail/ command should now point to mbsync.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (csetq mu4e-get-mail-command "mbsync -Va")
#+END_SRC

I had issues with duplicate IDs after moving and deleting messages from mu4e. [[http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/migrating-from-offlineimap-to-mbsync-for-mu4e/][Migrating from offlineimap to mbsync for mu4e]] had the answer:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (csetq mu4e-change-filenames-when-moving t)
#+END_SRC

At times, you may need GNU versions of command line utilities on macOS. For example, GNU find.

As usual, Homebrew saves the day. Install with:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install findutils

Unless you install with --with-default-names (I don't), GNU utilities will be prefixed with a "g".

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results verbatim
  gfind --version

Managing Email from Emacs. Surely that's crazy-talk, but hey... let's give it a try.

** Install offlineimap
Need to sync via imap. Use offlineimap. I'm on macOS, so homebrew is king for installing:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install offlineimap
#+END_SRC

Before can configure offlineimap, we'll need to handle a few things first.

** Get a cert fingerprint

Use openssl for getting a certificate fingerprint. From offlineimap's [[http://www.offlineimap.org/doc/FAQ.html#view-the-fingerprint][FAQ:]]

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  SSL_CERT_DIR="" openssl s_client -connect imap.migadu.com:993 < /dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -fingerprint -noout -text -in /dev/stdin
#+END_SRC

Should give you something like:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  SHA1 Fingerprint=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:DD:FF:AA:00:AA:2A:AA:AA:AA:A8:20:80:AA:A2:AA
#+END_QUOTE

** Encrypt password
Offlineimap can read passwords in plain text in its .offlineimaprc config file, but that's yuckie. Let's encrypt the password and use gnupg for that. Install it:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install gnupg
#+END_SRC

If you haven't already, generate a key

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  gpg --full-gen-key
#+END_SRC

Generate an offlineimap account password file.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  echo "YourPassword" | gpg --encrypt --recipient "Your Name" -o ~/.offlineimap_accountname.gpg
#+END_SRC

** Python password  wrapper

Based on Fabian's [[https://f-koehler.github.io/posts/2015-03-17-offlineimap-msmtp-gnupg.html][Encrypt OfflineIMAP and msmtp password with GnuPG]], I created ~/.read_password.py with:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  import os
  import subprocess

  def read_password(path):
    return subprocess.check_output(["gpg\n", "--quiet\n", "--batch\n", "-d\n", os.path.expanduser(path)]).strip()
#+END_SRC

ps. Alternatively, see [[http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/the-homely-mutt/#retrieving-passwords][The homely Mutt]]'s section to store password in macOS's keychain.

** Configure offlineimap

Offlineimap uses ~/.offlineimaprc for configuration. We now have all we need to put the configuration together:

#+BEGIN_SRC conf
[general]
accounts = Personal

# Load this python file.
pythonfile = ~/.read_password.py

[Account Personal]
localrepository = Personal-Local

remoterepository = Personal-Remote

# After syncing, let mu index it.
postsynchook = mu index --maildir ~/stuff/active/Mail

# Sync imap every 5 minutes.
autorefresh = 5

# Alternate between 10 quick syncs and full syncs.
quick = 10

[Repository Personal-Local]
type = Maildir
localfolders = ~/stuff/active/Mail/Personal

[Repository Personal-Remote]
type = IMAP
remotehost = some.imap.host.com
remoteuser = your_user_name

# Use function defined in .read_password.py to read the password.
remotepasseval = read_password("~/.offlineimap_personal_account_password.gpg")

# Use the SHA1 fingerprint retrieved with openssl.
cert_fingerprint = aabbccddeeddffaa00aa2aaaaaaaa82080aaa2aa
#+END_SRC

*** Cert file

You can use macOS's certificates from Keychain Access -> System Roots -> Certificates, select all, and ⌘-⇧-e (for export items). Save to ~/certs.pem and use offlineimap configutation:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
sslcacertfile = /path/to/certs.pem
#+END_QUOTE

Another option is executing lib/mk-ca-bundle.pl from curl's tarball to generate ca-bundle.crt, using certdata.txt from Mozilla's source tree.

** Install mu4e
Manually modified mu4e recipe to pick up my Emacs binary. TIL about homebrew's edit command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew edit mu
#+END_SRC

Changed the one line:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
- ENV["EMACS"] = "no" if build.without? "emacs"
+ ENV["EMACS"] = "/Users/alvaro/homebrew/Cellar/emacs-plus/26.1-rc1_2/bin/emacs"
#+END_QUOTE

Finally installed mu4e:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install mu
#+END_SRC

** Configure mu4e

Lastly, configure mu4e:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path
               (expand-file-name "~/homebrew/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu/mu4e"))

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: pre-commit-hooks-to-save-you-from-yourself
:END:
Wanted to try out some code, but needed to ensure never checked in. Git pre-commit hooks are handy in this space. Add the following script to search for either @COMMITFAIL or @NOCOMMIT in the staged files. If found, attempts to commit will fail.

Based on https://gist.github.com/rex/223b4be50285f6b8b3e06dea50d15887:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  #!/bin/bash

  set -o nounset
  set -o errexit

  echo "Arguments:"
  echo "$@"
  echo "---"

  readonly FILES_PATTERN='(\..+)?$'
  readonly FORBIDDEN='(@?NOCOMMIT|@?COMMITFAIL)'

  if ( git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E "$FILES_PATTERN" | xargs grep -E --with-filename -n "$FORBIDDEN" ); then
    echo "ERROR: @COMMITFAIL or @NOCOMMIT found. Exiting to save you from yourself."
    exit 1
  fi
#+END_SRC

Save to a file and create a symbolic link to your .git/hooks directory:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ln -s ../../git/commit-fail-pre-hook.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
#+END_SRC

* [2017-03-13 Mon] Installing gnuplot on macOS
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: installing-gnuplot-on-macos

UPDATE(2019-05-19 Sun): Plan A and B use options no longer available since the recent changes to [[https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/31510][remove all options from Homebrew/homebrew-core formulae]]. See Plan C.

** +Plan A+
*** +Install gnuplot Qt+
+If you have the resources, you can try the Qt flavor. You need at least 15GB to download and a long build. Ran out of space on my Macbook Air. Aborted.+
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install gnuplot --with-qt
#+END_SRC
** +Plan B+
*** +Install xquartz+
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz
#+END_SRC
*** +Install gnuplot x11+
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install gnuplot --with-x11
#+END_SRC

** Install feedgnuplot
Feedgnuplot is handy for plotting data streams realtime.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install feedgnuplot
#+END_SRC

**  Plan C
*** Install with no options
 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install gnuplot
 #+END_SRC

So far so good, but default gnuplot formula uses Qt and the Cocoa plugin could not be loaded:

 #+begin_quote
  qt.qpa.plugin: Could not find the Qt platform plugin "cocoa" in ""
 #+end_quote

*** Debugging
**** QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS

Turns out you can get plugin logs using the QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS environment variable:

#+begin_src sh
  export QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS=1
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
  QFactoryLoader::QFactoryLoader() checking directory path "/Users/myuser/homebrew/Cellar/gnuplot/5.2.6_1/libexec/gnuplot/5.2/platforms" ...
#+end_quote

This led me to find out about the /gnuplot/5.2/gnuplot_qt/ binary.

**** qt_prfxpath

Getting the Qt prefix can be done by inspecting QtCore's strings:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
  strings /Users/myuser/homebrew/Cellar/qt/5.12.3/Frameworks/QtCore.framework/QtCore | grep qt_prfxpath
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: qt_prfxpath=/usr/local/Cellar/qt/5.12.3

Ok so qt_prfxpath is pointing to //usr/local/Cellar/qt/, while my installation's is at //Users/myuser/homebrew/Cellar/qt/. This is problematic and indeed my fault for installing homebrew in //Users/myuser/homebrew/ instead of the recommended //usr/local/.

Symlinking did the job:

#+begin_src sh
  sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/Cellar
  sudo ln -s ~/homebrew/Cellar/qt /usr/local/Cellar/qt
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh
  /Users/myuser/homebrew/Cellar/gnuplot/5.2.6_1/libexec/gnuplot/5.2/gnuplot_qt
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: QFactoryLoader::QFactoryLoader() checking directory path "/Users/myuser/homebrew/Cellar/qt/5.12.3/plugins/platforms" ...
: QFactoryLoader::QFactoryLoader() looking at "/Users/myuser/homebrew/Cellar/qt/5.12.3/plugins/platforms/libqcocoa.dylib"
: Found metadata in lib /Users/myuser/homebrew/Cellar/qt/5.12.3/plugins/platforms/libqcocoa.dylib

Success.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: fuzzy-search-emacs-compile-history
:END:

I wrote about [[#search-bash-history-with-emacs-helm][searching bash history with Emacs Helm]] some time ago. Since then, I've learned about /completing-read/ to generically handle simple Emacs completions (very handy for supporting Helm, Ivy, and Ido completions).

Here's a simple way to combine /completing-read/ and the /compile/ command to enable fuzzy searching your compile history:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/fuzzy-search-emacs-compile-history/fuzzy_compile.gif]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun ar/compile-completing ()
    "Compile with completing options."
    (interactive)
    (let ((compile-command (completing-read "Compile command: " compile-history)))
      (compile compile-command)
      (add-to-list 'compile-history compile-command)))
#+END_SRC

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: jumping-on-emacs-25-bandwagon
:END:
Can't miss out on all the new fun. Emacs 25 RC2 is out and lots of people already using it. Since I'm mostly on MacOS these days, installing via homebrew with --devel, gets you RC2:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install emacs --devel --with-cocoa --with-gnutls --with-librsvg --with-imagemagick
#+END_SRC

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/jumping-on-emacs-25-bandwagon/emacs25.png]]

The only hiccup so far's been org mode failing to export, which was fixed by re-installing it (follow [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2015-08/msg00320.html][this thread]]).

* [2016-06-17 Fri] Emacs and emotional vocab
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: emacs-and-emotional-vocab
:END:
Having read [[http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/05/opinion/sunday/are-you-in-despair-thats-good.html][Are You in Despair? That’s Good]], I was encouraged to expand my emotional vocabulary. As a [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/play/zone.el][zone.el]] fan (checkout [[https://github.com/wasamasa/zone-nyan][nyan]], [[https://github.com/kawabata/zone-sl][sl]], and [[https://github.com/kawabata/zone-rainbow][rainbow]]), I looked into writing a zone [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/play/zone.el#L52][program]]. When /zone-when-idle/ is set, zone acts as a screensaver of sorts. We can use this to display random emotional vocab whenever Emacs is idle for a period of time. Let's get to it...

Zone keeps a list of programs to choose from when kicked off. Below is a basic /zone-hello/ program, along with an interactive command for previewing. Not much to these. The tiny program prepares the screen for zoning and inserts text while no input is pending.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun zone-hello ()
    (delete-other-windows)
    (setq mode-line-format nil)
    (zone-fill-out-screen (window-width) (window-height))
    (delete-region (point-min) (point-max))
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (while (not (input-pending-p))
      (insert "hello zone\n")
      (zone-park/sit-for (point-min) 0.2)))

  (defun zone-hello-preview ()
    (interactive)
    (let ((zone-programs [zone-hello]))
      (zone)))
#+END_SRC

Here's what /zone-hello/ looks like:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/emacs-and-emotional-vocab/minimal-zone.gif]]

Back to improving our emotional vocabulary, we'll need a dictionary for our goal. A quick search yields a potential list of [[http://www.psychpage.com/learning/library/assess/feelings.html][words]]. We can use [[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/][WordNet]] to define them while offline. These two sources will do for now. We tie it all together in [[https://github.com/xenodium/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/ar/zone-words.el][zone-words.el]] and the resulting zone program looks as follow:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%
[[file:images/emacs-and-emotional-vocab/emotions.gif]]

UPDATE: Just came across [[http://blog.josephwilk.net/art/emacs-animation.html][Animations With Emacs]]. A post with awesome zone examples.

Needed to find the number of days between two dates. Emacs calendar must know this...

- Fire up the manual (M-x info-emacs-manual or C-h r).
- Info-goto-node (or g).
- Type "counting days" and voilá:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
To determine the number of days in a range, set the mark on one date
using `C-<SPC>', move point to another date, and type `M-='
(`calendar-count-days-region').  The numbers of days shown is
_inclusive_; that is, it includes the days specified by mark and point.

:CUSTOM_ID: chocolate-fondant-recipe
:END:
My girlfriend recently made a delicious chocolate fondant. Saving the [[http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/feb/10/how-cook-perfect-chocolate-fondants][The Guardian's recipe]]:
** Ingredients (2 servings)
- 60g unsalted butter, cut into dice, plus extra to grease
- 1 tbsp cocoa powder
- 60g dark chocolate, broken into pieces
- 1 egg and 1 egg yolk
- 60g caster sugar
- 1 tbsp plain flour
** Preparation
1. Pre-heat the oven to 200C if cooking immediately, and put a baking tray on the middle shelf. Butter the inside of 2 small ramekins or pudding moulds, and then put the cocoa in one and turn it to coat the inside, holding it over the second mould to catch any that escapes. Do the same with the other mould.
2. Put the butter and chocolate into a heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a pan of simmering water and stir occasionally until melted. Allow to cool slightly.
3. Vigorously whisk together the egg, yolk, sugar and a pinch of salt until pale and fluffy. Gently fold in the melted chocolate and butter, and then the flour. Spoon into the prepared moulds, stopping just shy of the top – at this point the mixture can be refrigerated until needed, or even frozen, as the puddings will not wait around once cooked.
4. Put on to a hot baking tray and cook for 12 minutes (14 if from cold, 16 if frozen) until the tops are set and coming away from the sides of the moulds. Leave to rest for 30 seconds and then serve in the ramekins or turn out on to plates if you're feeling confident – they're great with clotted cream or plain ice cream.

From [[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gandhi-Changing-Mohandas-Karamchand-published/dp/B015GRZTP2][Gandhi: Radical Wisdom for a Changing World]]:
** Anger
"I do get angry, but I feel angry with myself for it. Full conquest of anger is possible only through self-realization. We should love even those who have the worst opinion of us. This is ahimsa, the rest is only ignorance."
** Bad handwriting
"I am now of opinion that children should first be taught the art of drawing before learning how to write. Let the child learn his letters by observation as he does different objectives, such as flowers, birds, etc., and let him learn handwriting only after he has learned to draw objects."
** Conduct of the Ashram
"Service without humility is selfishness and egotism."
** Eating
"There is a great deal of truth in the saying that man becomes what he eats. The grosser the food, the grosser the body."
** Heart
"There are chords in every human heart. If we only know how to strike the right chord, we bring out the music."
** Moral law
The law of truth and love.
** Renouncing or forgoing
Nishkulanand sings: "Renunciation of objects, without the renunciation of desires, is short-lived, however hard you may try."
** Silence
"Man spoils matters much more by speech than by silence."
** Time
"Every minute that runs to waste never returns. Yet, knowing this, how much time do we waste?"
** The palate
"Turn to the birds and beasts, and what do you find? They never eat merely to please the palate, they never go on eating till their inside is full to overflowing. And yet, we regard ourselves as superior to the animal creation!"
** Vow of Swadeshi
"The person who has taken the vow of swadeshi will never use articles which conceivably involve violation of truth in their manufature or on the part of their manufacturers."

Got a CD with my chest X-ray from the hospital. Was expecting a pdf or an image of sorts, but the CD content was rather different. For starters, it was targeted at Windows users (AUTORUN.INF, MediaViewerLauncher.EXE and a bunch of DLLs):

#+BEGIN_SRC text

  ./Worklist/Worklist.wl: application/octet-stream
#+END_SRC

I'm on a Mac, so most of these files were not useful to me. The more interesting files were IM_0001 and ED_0001 with "application/dicom" MIME type. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM][DICOM]] files stand for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine. How to view these on a Mac? [[http://www.osirix-viewer.com/Downloads.html][OsiriX viewer]] is an option. OsiriX, though on the heavy side (100.7MB download), it rendered the X-ray successfully.

[[file:images/view-dicom-files-from-your-x-ray/2015-12-03-osirix-x-ray-small.png]]

Unsurprisingly, ImageMagick's [[http://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php][convert]] utility also handles DICOM files. Converting to PNG worked well.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ convert ./DICOM/PAT_0000/STD_0000/SER_0001/OBJ_0001/ED_0001 ED_0001.png
#+END_SRC

[[file:images/view-dicom-files-from-your-x-ray/2015-12-03-imagemagick-x-ray-small.png]]


DICOM files also hold patient's metadata and optional reports. The file format is [[http://cabiatl.com/mricro/dicom/index.html][well known]]. OsiriX gives you access to it, but a few lines of python can also extract it for you. First install the [[https://github.com/darcymason/pydicom][pydicom]] package:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ sudo pip install pydicom
#+END_SRC

Running the python interpreter is enough to peak at the metadata:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  >>> import dicom
  >>> ds = dicom.read_file("./DICOM/PAT_0000/STD_0000/SER_0000/OBJ_0001/IM_0001")

* [2015-09-20 Sun] Chinatown treats review
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: chinatown-treats-review
:END:
** Recommended? yep
There's a corner in Chinatown hosting some truly superb treats. If you get caught in the rush between Newport court and Newport place, you'd likely fail to notice some the awesome street food stands.

[[file:images/chinatown-treats/chinatown.jpg]] [[file:images/chinatown-treats/newport-court.jpg]]

** Chilly squid
I've walked past this place many times and never noticed it. They serve a handful of items, but the grilled chilly squid skewers caught my attention. They're grilled, brushed with chilly sauce and finished with sprinkled sesame and cumin seeds. Super tasty.

[[file:images/chinatown-treats/squid-stand.jpg]]

[[file:images/chinatown-treats/chilly-squid-1.jpg]] [[file:images/chinatown-treats/chilly-squid-2.jpg]]

** Pancake + Crisp + Egg + Hot chillies = Jiān Bǐng 煎餅
I first had these delicious breakfast savory pancakes at a Beijing street food stall. Never expected to randomly find Jiān Bǐng in London. It's a crepe with an additional egg spread, hoisin sauce, chilly sauce, hot chillies, topped with spring onions and coriander, all wrapping a wonderfully crispy bread cracker. And.. it's awesome.

[[file:images/chinatown-treats/pancake-3.jpg]]

** Tai Yaki
Chinatown Bakery is hard to miss. Pedestrian traffic slows down as we all fall under the spell of the Tai Yaki machine. This wonderful assembly line produces fish-shaped sweet waffles filled with custard. They are the perfect dessert after some savory street snacks. You can get a bag of 4 for £2.

[[file:images/chinatown-treats/fish-1.jpg]]  [[file:images/chinatown-treats/fish-4.jpg]]

** All near each other
All these delights are within a stone's throw away from each other.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 75% :height 75%

** Useful?
Was this post useful to you? do [[https://twitter.com/xenodium/status/646101779281801216][reply]]!
** Better suggestion?
London is full of overhyped, gimmicky, and unnecessarily expensive restaurants. Very few deliver truly awesome food (even those expensive ones). Got suggestions? I'd love to hear from you [[https://twitter.com/xenodium][@xenodium]].

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: lucky-7-review
:END:
** Recommended? yep
[[http://www.lucky7london.co.uk][Lucky 7]] is a small nostalgic American diner on Westbourne Park road. I like the vibe, the space, and the unpretentious waiting staff. I go to Lucky 7 often enough, originally for the buttermilk pancakes, but the list of favorites on the menu keeps growing.

[[file:images/lucky-7-review/lucky-7-menu-board.jpg]]
[[file:images/lucky-7-review/lucky-7-staff.jpg]]

Smileys by [[https://openclipart.org/detail/219291/smile][w.dyer]].

** Buttermilk Banana pancakes
These are my favorite pancakes in London by far. Banana buttermilk pancakes and a few free coffee refills usually sort me out until dinner time. Add a side of bacon if extra hungry. You probably don't need it though.

[[file:images/lucky-7-review/lucky-7-coffee.jpg]]
[[file:images/lucky-7-review/lucky-7-pancakes.jpg]]

** Reuben sandwich
The reuben has been on Lucky 7's specials menu for months now. Not had many of these in London, but compared to The Brass Rail's, this reuben was a clear winner. The sandwich is huge and comes with fries. My girlfriend and I struggled to finish one between the two of us.

file:images/lucky-7-review/lucky-7-reuben-fries.jpg

file:images/lucky-7-review/lucky-7-reuben-cross-section.jpg

** Vanilla milkshake (add malt!)
This milkshake hits the spot every time, but it's filling. You almost have to decide between the shake and an actual meal. If you must have it, add malt. Sorry, no picture.
** Huevos Rancheros
This is a breakfast dish I can equally make (better?) at home, but Lucky 7 wins hands down every time I'm feeling particularly lazy. Sorry, no picture.
** Useful?
Was this post useful to you? do [[https://twitter.com/xenodium/status/643139264302186497][reply]]!
** Better suggestion?
London is full of overhyped, gimmicky, and unnecessarily expensive restaurants. Very few deliver truly awesome food (even those expensive ones). Got suggestions? I'd love to hear from you [[https://twitter.com/xenodium][@xenodium]].

I've loved my [[http://www.amazon.com/Soundmagic-PL30-In-Ear-Headphones/dp/B001MQ3CCO][Soundmagic PL30 in-ear headphones]]. They're relatively inexpensive, comfortable, and great for exercising (they stay in). Audio quality and bass have been good enough (I don't need much). Unfortunately, I've had two pairs of PL30's and both stopped working after a year or two. I'm replacing the last pair with [[http://www.amazon.co.uk/RHA-MA750-Isolating-In-Ear-Headphone-Black/dp/B00ELAM8LE][RHA's MA750]] (an upgrade, me hopes).

Other contenders considered: [[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Etymotic-Research-Portable-iPhone-Earphones-Black/dp/B000XPG2QI][Etymotic Research HF5]], and [[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Shure-SE215-In-Ear-Isolating-Earphones-Clear/dp/B004U9NH3E][Shure SE215]]. Also considered bluetooth alternatives like [[http://www.amazon.com/JayBird-BlueBuds-Sport-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B00AIRUOI8?][JayBird BlueBuds X]] and [[http://www.amazon.co.uk/Plantronics-BackBeat-Wireless-Earbuds-Frustration-Black/dp/B00DZTHW9U][Plantronics BackBeat GO 2]].

I'm somewhat nervous to pay more for a pair of headphones. Let's hope they don't meet the same unfortunate fate. We'll see.

There are three browser tabs continously used in my workflow: GMail, Google Calendar, and Google Play Music. I normally have many more tabs open, but these three I access periodically. As the number of open tabs increases, and I fail to cleanup, getting back to my usual three gets a little trickier.

So far, I've kept each of these services open in separate windows. But that doesn't always work. Click on any link in your inbox and you're back to playing cleanup. This is where [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site-specific_browser][site-specific browsers]] (SSB) can help.

[[https://github.com/dmarmor/epichrome][Epichrome]] enables you to build Chrome-based SSBs (on Mac OSX). Build an SSB for the usual suspects and easily jump to them using the app switcher.

OK not quite, but having recently learned about [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Appending-Kills.html][C-M-w (append-next-kill)]], I used it in a keyboard macro to fish out matching lines. This is similar to [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Other-Repeating-Search.html][flush-lines]], except the kill ring is also populated. This is handy, if you need the flushed lines. Here's an example.

* [2015-06-30 Tue] Searchable ebooks in Emacs
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: searchable-ebooks-in-emacs
:END:
If you haven't bought [[https://www.masteringemacs.org/book][Mastering Emacs]] by [[https://twitter.com/mickeynp][Mickey Petersen]], you should. It's a wonderful source of Emacs tips. Having just finished the ebook on my Kindle, I was keen to go back and fish out some of that newly found wisdom. My immediate reaction was to figure out a way to make the ebook searchable from Emacs.

The ebook is available in epub and pdf format. Though Emacs's docview is super handy for viewing pdf's, searching didn't feel as comfortable as searching in org mode. The epub, on the other hand, proved useful. [[http://pandoc.org][Pandoc]] can easily convert from epub to org.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pandoc  --from=epub --to=org mastering-emacs.epub > mastering-emacs.org
#+END_SRC

After a some tidying (mostly removing BEGIN_HTML/END_HTML blocks and adding TITLE/AUTHOR), the resulting org file is surprisingly clean and easy to search/navigate. [[https://github.com/ShingoFukuyama/helm-swoop][helm-swoop]] and [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/blob/199b9feb396eedc0e502dd767b19060f7dc09f6a/helm-org.el][helm-org-in-buffer-headings]] are great for that.

    class PopSinger {
      void sing()
    }

    class SalsaSinger {
      void sing()
    }

  @enduml
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:images/plantuml-example/plantuml-singer.png]]

Install plantuml on Mac OS X:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  brew install plantum
#+END_SRC

Generating diagram:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh

Want to re-evaluate defvars and modify variables? eval-defun (bound to C-M-x) can help. From the manual:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If the current defun is actually a call to `defvar', then reset the
variable using its initial value expression even if the variable
already has some other value.  (Normally `defvar' does not change the
variable's value if it already has a value.)  Treat `defcustom'
similarly.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: emacs-key-bindings-and-maps
:END:
** based on [[http://www.masteringemacs.org/article/mastering-key-bindings-emacs][masteringemacs.org]].
** bonus tip
prefix key, followed by c-h, lists keys in prefix.
** keymap
maps key to action.
** keymap found in buffer and most major modes.
** keys
- undefined: self explanatory.
- prefix key: ie. c-x (part of complete key).
- complete key: complete input executes associated command.
** mapping
- (define-key keymap key def): add to current buffer map.
- (local-set-key key command): add to active buffer (no map option).
- (local-unset-key key)
- (global-set-key key command): add to global keymap (all buffers).
- (global-unset-key key)
** key codes
- kbd: macro transaltes human-readable key to emacs readable.
- function and navigation keys must be surrounded by <>.
- example: (kbd "c-c p") or (kbd "<f8>") of (kbd "<down>").
** remapping
- use remap to replace mapping (ie. kill-line with my/kill-line).
- (define-key keymap [remap original-function] 'my-own-function).
** reserved keys
- "c-c ?" generally reserved for you, but third party packages use it.
- function keys (ie. f1-f12).
- hyper and super (ancient).
** lookup order
- in a nutshell: minor mode keys, local keys, global keys.
- full order:
  1. overriding-terminal-local-map: terminal-specific key binds.
  2. overriding-local-map: override all other local keymaps (avoid if possible).
  3. char property at point: useful for yasnippet.
  4. emulation-mode-map-alists: advanced multi-mode keymap.
  5. minor-mode-overriding-map-alist: minor modes in major modes.
  6. minor-mode-map-alist: as previous (preferred for minor modes) <-----
  7. current-local-map: buffers current local map.
  8. current-global-map: last place to look (ie. global).
** mode hooks
- (local-set-key (kbd "c-c q") 'my-awesome-method)) in hook-method.
- for key-chord-define, use current-local-map.

* [2013-11-04 Mon] Some python idioms
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: some-python-idioms
:END:
- Prefer double quotes if escaping single quotes.
- Prefer string interpolation over join. Eg. "'%s'" % member_default.
- Prefer double underscore for privates.
- Prefer with statement to implicitly close file.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  with open(path, 'r') as text_file:
      text = text_file.read()
#+END_SRC
- Prefer list comprehensions to filter.
- Prefer using separate modules over classes if only using for separation.
- Keep in mind: "eafp vs lbyl" (ie. just let it throw).
- Prefer exceptions over assertions.
- Throw ValueError for wrong input.
- Return explicit False if remaining case is always false.
