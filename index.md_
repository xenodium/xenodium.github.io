# \[2025-05-27 Tue\] Awesome Emacs on macOS
---
id: awesome-emacs-on-macos

Update: Added macOS Trash integration.

While GNU/Linux had been my operating system of choice for many years, these days I'm primarily on macOS. Lucky for me, I spend most of my time in Emacs itself (or a web browser), making the switch between operating systems a relatively painless task.

I build [iOS and macOS apps](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/xenodium-ltd/id304568690) for a living, so naturally I've accumulated a handful of macOS-Emacs integrations and tweaks over time. Below are some of my favorites.

## Emacs Plus

For starters, I should mention I run Emacs on macOS via the excellent [Emacs Plus](https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus) [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) recipe. These are the options I use:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install emacs-plus@30 --with-no-frame-refocus --with-native-comp --with-savchenkovaleriy-big-sur-curvy-3d-icon
```

## Valeriy Savchenko's icons

[Valeriy Savchenko](https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy) has created some wonderful [macOS Emacs icons](https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy/emacs-icons). These days, I use his [curvy 3D rendered icon](https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy/emacs-icons?tab=readme-ov-file#curvy-3d-rendered-icon), which I get via Emacs Plus's `--with-savchenkovaleriy-big-sur-curvy-3d-icon` option.

## Modifiers

It's been a long while since I've settled on using macOS's Command (⌘) as my Emacs Meta key. For that, you need:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(setq mac-command-modifier 'meta)
```

At the same time, I've disabled the ⌥ key to avoid inadvertent surprises.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(setq mac-option-modifier 'none)
```

## Enabling Control-Meta(⌘)-D

After setting ⌘ as Meta key, I discovered C-M-d is not available to Emacs for binding keys. There's a [little workaround](enabling-control-meta-d-on-macos):

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
defaults write com.apple.symbolichotkeys AppleSymbolicHotKeys -dict-add 70 '<dict><key>enabled</key><false/></dict>'
```

## Frames

You may have noticed the `--with-no-frame-refocus` Emacs Plus option. I didn't like Emacs refocusing other frames when closing one, so I [sent a tiny patch over to Emacs Plus](no-emacs-frame-refocus-on-macos), which gave us that option.

I also prefer reusing existing frames whenever possible.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(setq ns-pop-up-frames nil)
```

## Visual tweaks

Most of my visual tweaks have been documented in my [Emacs eye candy post](my-emacs-eye-candy). For macOS-specific things, read on…

It's been a while since I've added this, though vaguely remember needing it to fix mode line rendering artifacts.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(setq ns-use-srgb-colorspace nil)
```

I like using a transparent title bar and these two settings gave me just that:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-transparent-titlebar . t))
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-appearance . dark))
```

I want a menu bar like other macOS apps, so I enable with:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(use-package menu-bar
  :config
  (menu-bar-mode +1))
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/awesome-emacs-on-macos/menu-bar.webp)

## Emoji picker (a freebie!)

If you got a more recent Apple keyboard, you can [press the 🌐 key to insert emojis](emacs-freebie-macos-emoji-picker) from anywhere, including Emacs. If you haven't got this key, you can always `M-x ns-do-show-character-palette`, which launches the very same dialog.

Also check out Charles Choi's [macOS Native Emoji Picking in Emacs from the Edit Menu](http://yummymelon.com/devnull/macos-native-emoji-picking-in-emacs-from-the-edit-menu.html).

## Longing long press for accents?

If you prefer Apple's long-press approach to inserting accents or other special characters, I got [an Emacs version of that](an-accentuated-emacs-experiment).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/an-accentuated-emacs-experiment/accentuated.webp)

## Rotate macOS display

I wanted to rotate my monitor from the comfort of M-x, so I [made Emacs do it](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/emacs-rotate-my-macos-display).

## Open with

While there are different flavors of "open with default macOS app" commands out there (ie. crux-open-with as part of Bozhidar Batsov's [crux](https://github.com/bbatsov/crux)), I wanted one that [let me choose a specific macOS app](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/emacs-open-with-macos-app).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-open-with-macos-app/open-with_x2.webp)

## Open in Xcode (at line number)

Shifting from Emacs to Xcode via "Open with" is simple enough, but don't you want to also [visit the very same line](open-in-xcode-at-line-number)?

## SF Symbols (for work)

Apple offers [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) on all their platforms, so why not enable [Emacs to insert and render them?](emacs-insert-and-render-sf-symbols)

This is particulary handy if you do any sort of iOS/macOS development, enabling you to insert SF Symbols using your favorite completion framework. I happen to remain a faithful [ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) user.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-insert-and-render-sf-symbols/sf-insert-trimmed_x1.8.webp)

## SF Symbols (for fun)

Speaking of enabling SF Symbol rendering, you can also use them to spiff your Emacs up. Check out Charles Choi's [Calle 24](https://github.com/kickingvegas/calle24) for a great-looking Emacs toolbar. Also, Christian Tietze shows how to [use SF Symbols as Emacs tab numbers](https://christiantietze.de/posts/2022/12/sf-symbols-emacs-tab-numbers/).

## Quick kill

While macOS's Activity Monitor does a fine job killing processes, I wanted something a little speedier, so I went with a [killing solution leveraging Emacs completions](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/emacs-quick-kill-process).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-quick-kill-process/kill_x1.8.webp)

## SwiftUI a la org babel

Having learned how simple it was to [enable Objective-C babel support](org-babel-objective-c-support), I figured I could do something a little more creative with SwiftUI, so I published [ob-swiftui](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/ob-swiftui-updates) on MELPA.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/ob-swiftui-updates/file-render.gif)

## Changing macOS default apps

I found the nifty [duti](https://github.com/moretension/duti) command-line tool to change default macOS applications super handy, but could never remember its name when I needed it. And so I decided to bring it into [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) as part of my [toolbox](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#build-a-rich-toolbox-or-use-mine).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/hey-emacs-change-the-default-macos-app-for/set-default_x1.3.webp)

I got a bunch of handy helpers in [dwim-shell-commands.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-commands.el) (specially all the image/video helpers via ffmpeg and imagemagick). Go check [dwim-shell-commands.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-commands.el). There's loads in there, but here are my macOS-specific commands:

-   dwim-shell-commands-macos-add-to-photos
-   dwim-shell-commands-macos-bin-plist-to-xml
-   dwim-shell-commands-macos-caffeinate
-   dwim-shell-commands-macos-convert-to-mp4

-   dwim-shell-commands-macos-toggle-display-rotation
-   dwim-shell-commands-macos-toggle-menu-bar-autohide
-   dwim-shell-commands-macos-version-and-hardware-overview-info

## Toggle dark mode

Continuing on the `dwim-shell-commands` family, I should also mention `dwim-shell-commands-macos-toggle-dark-mode`.

While I hardly ever change my Emacs theme, I do toggle macOS dark mode from time to time to test macOS or web development.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/awesome-emacs-on-macos/dark-toggle.gif)

## Menu bar auto hide

One last `dwim-shell-command`… One that showcases [toggling the macOS menu bar (autohide)](toggle-macos-menu-bar-from-you-know-where).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/toggle-macos-menu-bar-from-you-know-where/autohide.webp)

## Connect to your Bluetooth speaker

While this didn't quite stick for me, it was a fun experiment to [add Emacs into the mix](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/emacs-connect-my-bluetooth-speaker).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-connect-my-bluetooth-speaker/connect-disconnect.gif)

## Eshell

This is just a little fun banner I see whenever I launch [eshell](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/awesome-emacs-on-macos/eshell.png)

This is all you need:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(use-package em-banner
  :custom
  (eshell-banner-message "
\x1b[32m                             'c.                    \x1b[0m

\x1b[34m  _/_/_/  _/_/_/    _/    _/    _/_/_/  _/  _/      \x1b[0m


"))
```

## Screencasts

I wanted a quick way to record or take screenshots of macOS windows, so I now have [my lazy way](recordscreenshot-windows-the-lazy-way), leveraging [macosrec](https://github.com/xenodium/macosrec), a recording command line utility I built. Invoked via `M-x` of course.

## Eglot (LSP) for iOS/macOS dev

If you want any sort of code completion for your macOS projects, you'd be happy to know that eglot works out of the box.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(use-package eglot
  :ensure t
  :hook (swift-mode . eglot-ensure)
  :config
  (message "warning: `jsonrpc--log-event' is ignored.")
  (fset #'jsonrpc--log-event #'ignore)
  (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '(swift-mode . ("/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/sourcekit-lsp"))))
```

## Search and play (Music app)

This is another experiment that didn't quite stick, but I played with [controlling the Music app's playback](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/emacs-searchplay-music-macos).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-searchplay-music-macos/music_search.gif)

While I still purchase music via Apple's Music app, I now play directly from Emacs via [Ready Player Mode](a-tour-of-ready-player-mode). I'm fairly happy with this setup, having scratched that itch with my own package.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/open-file.gif)

By the way, those buttons also leverage SF Symbols on macOS.

## Reveal -\> all \<- in Finder

While there are plenty of solutions out there leveraging the `open` command line tool to reveal files in macOS's Finder, I wanted one that revealed multiple files in one go. For that, I [leveraged](native-emacsmacos-ux-integrations-via-swift-modules) the awesome [emacs-swift-module](https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy/emacs-swift-module), also by [Valeriy Savchenko](https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/native-emacsmacos-ux-integrations-via-swift-modules/reveal.webp)

## Use the macOS Trash

The macOS trash has saved my bacon in more than one occasion. [Make Emacs aware of it](rm-important-txt-oh-sht/). Also check out `M-x dwim-shell-commands-macos-empty-trash`.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/rm-important-txt-oh-sht/recovered_x1.6.webp)

## Build your own macOS utils

While elisp wasn't in my top languages to learn back in the day, I sure am glad I finally bit the bullet and learned a thing or two. This opened many possibilities. I now see Emacs as a platform to build utilities and tools off of. A [canvas of sorts](its-all-up-for-grabs-and-it-compounds), to be leveraged in and out of the editor.

For example, you could [build your own bookmark launcher](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/building-your-own-bookmark-launcher) and invoke from anywhere on macOS.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/building-your-own-bookmark-launcher/launcher.gif)

## Emacs as default email composer

Turns out you can also [make Emacs your default email composer](mu4e-as-macos-mail-composer).

## Emacs key bindings everywhere

While not exactly an Emacs tweak itself, I wanted to extend Emacs bindings into other macOS apps. In particular, I wanted [more reliable Ctrl-n/p usage everywhere](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/improved-ctrl-p-ctrl-n-macos-movement), which I achieved via [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/). I also mapped `C-g` to `Esc`, which really feels just great! I can now cancel things, dismiss menus, dialogs, etc. everywhere.

## Org as lingua franca

With my Emacs usage growing over time, it was a matter of time until I discovered org mode. This blog is well over 11 years old now, yet still powered by the [very same org file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenodium/xenodium.github.io/refs/heads/master/index.org) (beware, this file is big).

With my org usage growing, I felt like I was missing org support outside of Emacs. And so I started building iOS apps revolving around my Emacs usage.

### Journelly (iOS)

[Journelly](journelly-like-tweeting-but-for-your-eyes-only) is my latest iOS app, centered around note-taking and journaling. The app feels like tweeting, but for your eyes only of course. It's powered by org markup, which can be synced with Emacs via iCloud.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/journelly-like-tweeting-but-for-your-eyes-only/sideways.jpg)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/journelly-like-tweeting-but-for-your-eyes-only/emacs.gif)

### Flat Habits (iOS)

[Org habits](https://orgmode.org/manual/Tracking-your-habits.html) are handy for tracking daily habits. However, it wasn't super practical for me as I often wanted to check things off while on the go (away from Emacs). That led me to build [Flat Habits](flat-habits-for-ios).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/frictionless-org-habits-on-ios/flat_habits.gif)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/flat-habits-meets-org-agenda/flat_agenda.gif)

### Scratch (iOS)

While these days I'm using [Journelly](https://journelly.com/) to jot down just about anything, before that, I built and used [Scratch](scratch-a-minimal-scratch-area) as scratch pad of sorts. No iCloud syncing, but needless to say, it's also powered by org markup.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/scratch-a-minimal-scratch-area/scratch-download_no_audio_x2.6.webp)

### Plain Org (iOS)

For more involved writing, nothing beats Emacs org mode. But what if I want quick access to my org files while on the go? [Plain Org](https://plainorg.com/) is my iOS solution for that.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/awesome-emacs-on-macos/plain-org.png)

## A happy Journelly user

Just as I'm getting ready to announce Journelly's 1.1 release, [Ellane](https://ellanew.com/about) (from [ellanew.com](https://ellanew.com)) shared a wonderful blog post on her experience using version 1.0:

[Journelly is the Org App You’ll Love (Even if You Don’t Do Org)](https://ellanew.com/ptpl/157-2025-05-19-journelly-is-org-for-those-who-dont-do-org).

I'm particulary excited to hear from Ellane given her [Plain Text; Paper, Less](https://ellanew.com/ptpl) philosophy.

<center>
<small>
<p>"It’s the perfect mix of simplicity and low-tech plain text wizardry"</p>
<p>"It takes a very particular set of features for a new app to impress me enough to hit the purchase button as fast as I did with Journelly."</p>
<p>"Journelly is the first Org-powered app I’ve seen that lays out the welcome mat for people who don’t even know what Org is, never mind how to use it."</p>
<a href="https://ellanew.com/ptpl/157-2025-05-19-journelly-is-org-for-those-who-dont-do-org">Ellane / ellanew.com</a>
</small>
</center>

As an [org mode](https://orgmode.org/) enthusiast myself, I'm delighted to hear Journelly is paving a gentle road for org newcomers.

Ellane's post also has a great list of features requests. Lucky for me, I can report at least two of them are covered by today's release:

-   The new hashtag picker.
-   Pasting images from the clipboard.

Be sure to check out [Ellane's post](https://ellanew.com/ptpl/157-2025-05-19-journelly-is-org-for-those-who-dont-do-org), as she covers many details I'm not mentioning here. But lemme share one last tip I learned from her post today…

## Ellane's iCloud tip

Today I learned something new from Ellane’s [post](https://ellanew.com/ptpl/157-2025-05-19-journelly-is-org-for-those-who-dont-do-org): you can Control-click the Journelly iCloud Drive folder on your Mac and select "Keep Downloaded" to ensure your notes are always available offline. Super handy, specially for those of us using Emacs on macOS.

## Markdown enthusiast? Enquire within

Currently, Journelly stores entries in Org plain text format, but Markdown support is on the way. Interested in Markdown? [Please reach out](mailto:journelly+markdown@xenodium.com?subject=I'm%20interested%20Markdown%20for%20Journelly&body=Just%20want%20to%20register%20my%20interest%20in%20Markdown%20support%20for%20Journelly). The more requests I receive, the sooner it will land.

On the topic of Markdown: I also run [lmno.lol](https://lmno.lol/), a Markdown-powered blogging service. Simple and focused, without the frustrating parts of the modern web. Custom domains are welcome too! My [xenodium.com]() blog runs off [lmno.lol](https://lmno.lol/).

When it comes to programming LLM tools, I've seen modes of interaction in the form of code completion, patch application, improvement suggestions, and text chat amongst others. Text chat is everywhere.

In the context of text chat UX, I haven't really come across huge differentiators across offerings. That's not to say they don't exist. The landscape moves fast and there are far too many products out there for me to check out, thus my question to you is…

## Who's optimizing or innovating LLM text chat UX?

While there are plenty of new agents and model capabilities that are interesting in their own right, in the context of chat UX, I'm more interested in finding your favorite UX features. What are they? What do you love about them? Why? Do they feel like they reached or are close to reaching an optimal experience? On the other hand, what do you find that's rough about them? Tiny friction here and there? I'd love to know: [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xenodium) / [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/xenodium) / [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/xenodium.bsky.social).

## Chat as a shell, is it keyboard optimized?

Back in 2023, I released the [first version of chatgpt-shell](a-chatgpt-emacs-shell). To me, LLM chats felt like the perfect candidates to be implemented as shells. After all, aren't they just [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)s of sorts?

1.  Reads user input
2.  Evaluates the input
3.  Prints the result
4.  Loops back to read more input

While this mode of LLM interaction served me well for some time, I couldn't shake the feeling there were tiny improvements to be made to shed a little friction here and there.

## TAB navigation

Not all LLM output is equal. I want to quickly jump to more interesting items like code blocks or links (via keyboard of course). Sure, I can search to navigate around, but don't we have better patterns already? Don't we often just TAB our way around apps and web pages?

With that, I added TAB and Shift-TAB navigation to chatgpt-shell.

## Editable vs read-only (why not both?)

Most LLM text chat interfaces I've come across are made up of two components: the input text-box and the history of input requests along with their corresponding LLM outputs. While using the text-box, keyboard shortcuts are somewhat limited to modifier key shortcuts. I'd love to have a richer menu of options available or ways to quickly ask for things, without explicitly having to request a different interaction mode nor a menu of sorts. Circumstances aren't that different in a shell when you have to switch between character and line mode. In a way, the clunkiness intensifies when you'd like to input multi-line text through your shell. You better watch out for that muscle memory and avoid pressing enter prematurely while you intended to add a newline… Too late. Your incomplete request is already on its way.

With all this in mind, it's easy to dismiss shell foundations given their quirks. The thing is, we don't have to throw the baby out with the bathwater. What we need is a veneer of sorts, automatically switching between edit and view mode just when you need it.

## Reducing history noise

While I want to have access to my LLM chat history (ie. the context), I'm hardly ever interested in seeing anything but the last LLM response. An always-present history feels like constant noise to me. If I want to see the history, I'd like to actively ask for it. Remember that veneer of sorts? Well, can't it act as viewport too? …showing me only the very last response. Want access to previous entries? Can it act as a pager also? One interaction per page (request + response). But if I really want to open the history floodgates, just give me access to the "raw" shell… and so I started [experimenting with pagers of sorts](an-experimental-e-shell-pager).

## One chat interface to rule them all

With my initial chatgpt-shell implementation, I envisioned multi-model chat support would be possible by isolating shell logic into a separate package ([shell-maker](a-chatgpt-shell-compose-ux-experiment)) and let folks build whichever LLM chat they'd like (adding support for their favorite model).

While new shells started popping up here and there, I didn't foresee minor shell UX differences affecting general user experience. Learning the quirks of each new shell felt like unnecessary friction in developing muscle memory. I also became dependent on chatgpt-shell features, which I often missed when using some of the other shells. In the end, I bit the bullet and [made chatgpt-shell go multi-model](chatgpt-shell-goes-multi-model).

## Tying it all together

TAB navigation, a smart veneer, a viewport, paging, optional access to chat history, a transient menu, a single interface driving different models, and a bunch of other tweaks currently make up chatgpt-shell's compose experience, available via Emacs's `M-x chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose` command or my preferred key binding: `C-c C-e`.

Today, I bring another tweak. Compose buffers get a brand new header presenting all relevant shell details including model and paging information.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/llm-text-chat-is-everywhere-whos-optimizing-ux/compose-header.gif)

The new compose header is now available in the latest MELPA package version. Invoke `M-x chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose` and off you go. It's pretty fresh, so please report issues.

## Back to the original question…

What are some of the text chat UX features you love? Bonus points if they are keyboard driven.

# \[2025-05-16 Fri\] A richer Journelly org capture template
---
id: a-richer-journelly-org-capture-template
---

In addition to including user content, [Journelly](https://journelly.com/) entries typically bundle a few extra details like timestamp, location, and weather information, which look a little something like this:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-richer-journelly-org-capture-template/rice-guys.jpg)

Behind the scenes, Journelly entries follow a fairly simple org structure:

``` org
* [2025-04-23 Wed 13:24] @ Waterside House
:PROPERTIES:
:LATITUDE: 51.518714352892665
:LONGITUDE: -0.17575820941499262
:WEATHER_TEMPERATURE: 11.4°C
:WEATHER_CONDITION: Mostly Cloudy
:WEATHER_SYMBOL: cloud
:END:

[[file:Journelly.org.assets/images/C5890C25-5575-4F52-80D9-CE0087E9986C.jpg]]
```

While out and capturing entries from my iPhone, I rely on Journelly to leverages iOS location and weather APIs to include relevant information. On the other hand, when capturing from my Macbook, I rely on a basic Emacs org capture template (very similar to [Jack Baty's](https://baty.net/posts/2025/04/journelly-org-mode-backed-journaling-for-i-os/)):

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(setq org-capture-templates
      '(("j" "Journelly" entry (file "path/to/Journelly.org")
         "* %U @ Home\n%?" :prepend t)))
```

These templates yield straightforward entries like:

``` org
* [2025-05-16 Fri 12:42] @ Home
A simple entry from my Macbook.
```

I've been using this capture template for some time. It does a fine job, though you'd notice location and weather info aren't captured. No biggie, since the location of my laptop isn't typically relevant, but hey today seemed like a perfect day to get [nerd snipped](https://xkcd.com/356/) by [\@natharari](https://bsky.app/profile/natharari.bsky.social/post/3lpbkzcduo223).

And so, off I went, to look for a utility to capture location from the command line. I found [CoreLocationCLI](https://github.com/fulldecent/corelocationcli), which leverages the equivalent macOS location APIs. As a bonus, the project seemed active (modified only a few days ago).

Installing CoreLocationCLI via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) was a breeze:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install corelocationcli
```

The first time you run corelocationcli, you'll get an message like:

    "CoreLocationCLI" can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer...

You'll need to follow [CoreLocationCLI](https://github.com/fulldecent/corelocationcli)'s instructions:

    To approve the process and allow CoreLocationCLI to run, go to System Settings ➡️ Privacy & Security ➡️ General, and look in the bottom right corner for a button to click.

After approving the process, I ran into a snag:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
$ CoreLocationCLI
CoreLocationCLI: ❌ The operation couldn’t be completed. (kCLErrorDomain error 0.)
```

Lucky for me, the [README](https://github.com/fulldecent/corelocationcli) had the solution:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
Note for Mac users: make sure Wi-Fi is turned on. Otherwise you will see kCLErrorDomain error 0.
```

Oddly, my WiFi was turned on, so I went ahead and toggled it. Success:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
$ CoreLocationCLI
51.51871 -0.17575
```

We can start by wrapping this command-line utility to return coordinates along with reverse geolocation (ie. description):

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun journelly-get-location ()
  "Get current location.

Return in the form:

`((lat . 51.51871)
  (lon . -0.17575)
  (description . \"Sunny House\"))

Signals an error if the location cannot be retrieved."
  (unless (executable-find "CoreLocationCLI")
    (error "Needs CoreLocationCLI (try brew install corelocationcli)"))
  (with-temp-buffer
    (if-let ((exit-code (call-process "CoreLocationCLI" nil t nil
                                      "--format" "%latitude\t%longitude\t%thoroughfare"))
             (success (eq exit-code 0))
             (parts (split-string (buffer-string) "\t")))
        `((lat . ,(string-to-number (nth 0 parts)))
          (lon . ,(string-to-number (nth 1 parts)))
          (description . ,(string-trim (nth 2 parts))))
      (error "No location available"))))
```

A quick check shows it's working as expected.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(journelly-get-location)
```

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
'((lat . 51.51871)
  (lon . -0.17575)
  (description . "Waterside House"))
```

Now that we're able to get the current location, we need a way to fetch weather info. I discarded using WeatherKit on macOS for its dependence on a developer account and obtaining an API key. No worries, I found the great [MET Norway API](https://api.met.no/) which is freely available without the need for keys.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun journelly-fetch-weather (lat lon)
  "Fetch weather data from MET Norway API for LAT and LON.

Return the parsed JSON object."
  (let* ((url (format "https://api.met.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/2.0/compact?lat=%s&lon=%s" lat lon))
         (args (list "-s" url)))
    (with-temp-buffer
      (apply #'call-process "curl" nil t nil args)
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (json-parse-buffer :object-type 'alist))))
```

We can take it for a spin with:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(journelly-fetch-weather 51.51871 -0.17575)
```

We get a nice object with a chunky time series (cropped for readability):

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
((type . "Feature")
 (geometry (type . "Point") (coordinates . [-0.1758 51.5187 30]))
 (properties
  (meta (updated_at . "2025-05-16T11:17:44Z")
        (units (air_pressure_at_sea_level . "hPa")
               (air_temperature . "celsius")
               (cloud_area_fraction . "%")
               (precipitation_amount . "mm") (relative_humidity . "%")
               (wind_from_direction . "degrees") (wind_speed . "m/s")))
  (timeseries
   . [((time . "2025-05-16T12:00:00Z")
       (data
        (instant
         (details (air_pressure_at_sea_level . 1025.6)
                  (air_temperature . 18.0) (cloud_area_fraction . 4.7)
                  (relative_humidity . 44.2)
                  (wind_from_direction . 17.6) (wind_speed . 3.6)))
        (next_12_hours (summary (symbol_code . "fair_day")) (details))
        (next_1_hours (summary (symbol_code . "clearsky_day"))
                      (details (precipitation_amount . 0.0)))
        (next_6_hours (summary (symbol_code . "clearsky_day"))
                      (details (precipitation_amount . 0.0)))))

      ...


     ((time . "2025-05-26T00:00:00Z")
       (data
        (instant
         (details (air_pressure_at_sea_level . 1007.3)
                  (air_temperature . 12.6)
                  (cloud_area_fraction . 28.1)
                  (relative_humidity . 91.3)
                  (wind_from_direction . 258.7) (wind_speed . 3.5)))))])))

```

Journelly entries need only a tiny subset of the returned object, so let's add a helper to extract and format as preferred.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun journelly-fetch-weather-summary (lat lon)
  "Fetch weather data from MET Norway API for LAT and LON.

Return in the form:

 '((temperature . \"16.9°C\")
   (symbol . \"cloudy\"))."
  (let* ((data (journelly-fetch-weather lat lon))
         (now (current-time))
         (entry (seq-find
                 (lambda (entry)
                   (let-alist entry
                     (time-less-p now (date-to-time .time))))
                 (let-alist data
                   .properties.timeseries)))
         (unit (let-alist data
                 .properties.meta.units.air_temperature)))
    (unless entry
      (error "Couldn't fetch weather data"))
    (let-alist entry
      `((temperature . ,(format "%.1f%s"
                                .data.instant.details.air_temperature
                                (cond
                                 ((string= unit "celsius") "°C")
                                 ((string= unit "fahrenheit") "°F")
                                 (t (concat " " unit)))))
        (symbol . ,(alist-get 'symbol_code .data.next_1_hours.summary))))))
```

We can take it for a spin with:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(journelly-fetch-weather-summary 51.51871 -0.17575)
```

Nice! Look at that weather, it's a sign I should finish writing and go outside!

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
'((temperature . "19.0°C")
  (symbol . "clearsky_day"))
```

I really should go outside, but I'm just so close now… Or so I thought! That symbol (ie. "clearsky_day") isn't recognizable by Journelly, which relies on [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) returned by [WeatherKit](https://developer.apple.com/weatherkit/). I need a mapping of sorts between these symbols. Gosh, I do need to go outside. Let's speed things along. This is a perfect task for a robot! Whipped [chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell) out and asked the LLM robots to take on this grunt work, who gave me:

``` json
{
  "clearsky_day": "sun.max",
  "clearsky_night": "moon.stars",
  "clearsky_polartwilight": "sun.horizon",
  ...
  "snowshowers_and_thunder_day": "cloud.sun.bolt.snow",
  "snowshowers_and_thunder_night": "cloud.moon.bolt.snow",
  "thunderstorm": "cloud.bolt"
}
```

We're in elisp land so who wants json? Hey robot, I need an alist:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-richer-journelly-org-capture-template/chatgpt-shell.png)

Won't the LLM make mapping errors? Most certainly! But for now, I'm just getting a rough prototype and I need to get moving if I want to go outside!

We plug our mapping into an elisp function

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun journelly-resolve-metno-to-sf-symbol (symbol)
  "Resolve Met.no weather SYMBOL strings to a corresponding SF Symbols."
  (let ((symbols '(("clearsky_day" . "sun.max")
                   ("clearsky_night" . "moon.stars")
                   ("clearsky_polartwilight" . "sun.horizon")
                   ...
                   ("snowshowers_and_thunder_day" . "cloud.sun.bolt.snow")
                   ("snowshowers_and_thunder_night" . "cloud.moon.bolt.snow")
                   ("thunderstorm" . "cloud.bolt"))))
    (map-elt symbols symbol)))
```

Does it work? Kinda seems like it.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(journelly-resolve-metno-to-sf-symbol
 (map-elt (journelly-fetch-weather-summary 51.51871 -0.17575) 'symbol))
```

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
"sun.max"
```

We got everything we need now, let's put the bits together:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun journelly-generate-metadata ()
  (let* ((location (journelly-get-location))
         (weather (journelly-fetch-weather-summary
                   (map-elt location 'lat)
                   (map-elt location 'lon))))
    (format "%s
:PROPERTIES:
:LATITUDE: %s
:LONGITUDE: %s
:WEATHER_TEMPERATURE: %s
:WEATHER_SYMBOL: %s
:END:"
            (or (map-elt location 'description) "-")
            (map-elt location 'lat)
            (map-elt location 'lon)
            (alist-get 'temperature weather)
            (journelly-resolve-metno-to-sf-symbol
             (alist-get 'symbol weather)))))
```

Lovely, we now get the metadata we need in the expected format.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
Waterside House
:PROPERTIES:
:LATITUDE: 51.51871
:LONGITUDE: -0.17575
:WEATHER_TEMPERATURE: 18.5°C
:WEATHER_SYMBOL: sun.max
:END:
```

Damn, the temperature is dropping. I really do need to go outside. So close now!

All we have to do is plug our `journelly-generate-metadata` function into our org template and… Bob's your uncle!

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(setq org-capture-templates
      '(("j" "Journelly" entry (file "path/to/Journelly.org")
         "* %U @ %(journelly-generate-metadata)\n%?" :prepend t)))
```

We can now invoke our trusty `M-x org-capture` and off we go…

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-richer-journelly-org-capture-template/journelly.jpeg)

While the code currently lives in my Emacs config, it's [available on GitHub](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/ar/journelly.el). If you do take it for a spin, it may crash and burn. I blame the weather. In the UK, when sunny, you rush to go outside! 🌞🏃‍♂️💨

# \[2025-05-01 Thu\] Journelly: like tweeting but for your eyes only (in plain text)
---
id: journelly-like-tweeting-but-for-your-eyes-only
---

On iOS, we're spoiled for choice when it comes to note-taking, journaling, or social media apps. In note-taking alone, I've flip-flopped back and forth between different note-taking and journaling apps. For one reason or another, none would stick. My initial attempt at building such an app faded just the same. That is, until I realized what I really wanted was a cocktail of sorts, combining user experiences from all three kinds. Only then, I finally gained some traction and Journelly was truly born.

I'm happy to share that, as of today, Journelly is generally available on the App Store. Check out [journelly.com](https://journelly.com) for all app details or just read on...

<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id6470714669"><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/journelly-like-tweeting-but-for-your-eyes-only/icon.png" alt="download-on-app-store.png" width="180px"/></a><br><br>

## Like tweeting, but for your eyes only

While bringing social to note-taking was categorically never a goal, we got a thing or two we can draw from social media apps. They make it remarkably easy to browse and just share stuff.

All my previous mobile note-taking attempts failed to stick around almost exclusively because of friction. By bringing a social-media-like feed to my notes and making it remarkably easy to just add and search for things, app stickiness quickly took off.

Of course, these being my personal notes, privacy is non-negotiable. With Journelly being offline by default, combining elements from note-taking, journaling, and social media apps, I came to think of Journelly's experience as "tweeting but for your eyes only".

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/journelly-like-tweeting-but-for-your-eyes-only/sideways.jpg)

## Is it a notes app? Journaling app? It's whatever you want it to be…

I like how journaling apps automatically bundle timestamps with your entries and maybe additional information like location or even weather details. At the same time, splitting my writing between two apps (quick notes vs. journaling) always felt like unnecessary friction. Even having to decide which app to launch felt like a deterrent.

While my typical Journelly use-case hops between taking notes, journaling, today's grocery shopping list, saving a few links from the web, music, movies—the list goes on… jcs from [Irreal](https://irreal.org/blog/) puts it best: "[Journelly is a bit of a shape shifter](https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12908)." With just enough structure (but not too much), Journelly can serve all sorts of use-cases.

## No lock-in (powered by org plain text)

While I want a smooth mobile note-taking experience, I also don't want my notes to live in a data island of sorts. I'm a fan of plain text. I've been writing my notes and blog posts at [xenodium.com]() using [Org](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-syntax.html) plain text for well over a decade now, so my solution naturally had to have some plain text thrown at it.

Journelly stores entries using [Org](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-syntax.html) markup for now, but [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) is coming too. Interested in Markdown support? [Please reach out](mailto:journelly+markdown@xenodium.com?subject=I'm%20interested%20Markdown%20for%20Journelly&body=Just%20want%20to%20register%20my%20interest%20in%20Markdown%20support%20for%20Journelly). The more requests I receive, the sooner I'll get it out the door. Oh, and since we're talking Markdown, I also launched [lmno.lol](https://lmno.lol/), a Markdown-powered blogging service (minus the yucky bits of the modern web). Custom domains are welcome too. My [xenodium.com]() blog runs off [lmno.lol](https://lmno.lol/).

Is it really powered by Org markup? Go ahead and fire up your beloved [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Zed](https://zed.dev/)… and take a peek. It's just text.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/journelly-like-tweeting-but-for-your-eyes-only/emacs.gif)

Having shown you all of that, this is all just cherry on the implementation cake. You need not know anything about markups to use Journelly. Just open the app and start writing.

## iCloud syncing (optional)

While Journelly is offline by default, you may optionally sync with other devices via iCloud.

Folks have reported using [Working Copy](https://workingcopy.app), [Sushitrain](https://github.com/pixelspark/sushitrain), or [Möbius Sync](https://mobiussync.com) for syncing, though your mileage may vary. As of v1, I can only offer iCloud as the officially supported provider.

## Searching + hashtags

There's little structure enforced on Journelly entries. Write whatever you want. If you want some categorization, sprinkle entries with your favorite hashtags. They're automatically actionable on tap, enabling quick searches in the future.

## Thank you beta testers!

Nearly 300 folks signed up to [Journelly's TestFlight](journelly-open-for-beta). Thank you for testing, reporting issues, and all the great suggestions. While many of your feature requests made it to the launch, I've had to defer quite few to enable the v1 release. The good news is I now have a healthy backlog I can work on to bring features over time.

## Support indie development

The [App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/) is a crowded place. Building ✨sustainable✨ iOS apps is quite the challenge, especially when doing right by the user. Journelly steers clear of ads, tracking, distractions, bloat, lock-in, and overreaching permissions. It embraces open formats like [Org](https://orgmode.org) markup, safeguarding the longevity of your data.

Support independent development.

# \[2025-04-02 Wed\] Journelly vs Emacs: Why Not Both?
---
id: journelly-vs-emacs-why-not-both
---

[JTR](https://indieweb.social/@jtr@fosstodon.org) recently [posted](https://taonaw.com/2025/04/01/irreal-likes-ramrezs-journelly-irrealorg.html) an interesting question in response to Irreal's [post](https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12880) wondering [why he feels the need to use something that is not Emacs for quick notes?](https://taonaw.com/2025/04/01/irreal-likes-ramrezs-journelly-irrealorg.html) While I'm in no position to speak on behalf of Irreal, I am the Ramírez building this Journelly app JTR speaks of ;-)

From my perspective as the author, I'm building this app to fill a void I have, complementing my org-mode usage. In my opinion, it's not a question of whether to use Journelly over Emacs. I freakin' love Emacs org. I don't want to give it up. If the apps speak to each other, the question I'd rather ask is: why not use both?

When I’m on my computer, nearly all my writing goes through org-mode. I’ve been an org fan for well over a decade. My blog is powered by a [single org file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenodium/xenodium.github.io/refs/heads/master/index.org) (be warned, it's a chunky file).

It's no secret I'm also an Emacs fan. I love how this platform [moulds to my needs](a-platform-that-moulds-to-your-needs). But when I’m on the go and on my iPhone, I want a different experience — quick mobile access, minimal ceremony, optimized for smaller touch screens. I want to capture quick notes on the go, with as little friction as possible. Optionally, I want to include photos, lists, checklists, location, weather, timestamps… I also want this experience to feel like other well-integrated iOS apps. The way I like to put it is: Journelly sorta feels like tweeting, but for your eyes only.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/journelly-vs-emacs-why-not-both/journelly.gif)

At the same time, I don’t want my mobile note-taking experience to live in a data island. After all, I'm still an org fan. So… why not use both apps? My goal for Journelly is to provide a mobile-optimized experience that happens to speak org and thus complement my existing org usage.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/journelly-vs-emacs-why-not-both/storage.jpg)

While Journelly is offline by default, you may choose a different location for your data, enabling you to access it from your beloved editor.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/journelly-vs-emacs-why-not-both/emacs.png)

Back to the original question: why use another tool for quick notes other than Emacs? Journelly isn't meant to replace Emacs, but rather complement it. In a way, Journelly isn't that different from Beorg, which was mentioned in JTR's post. Both apps speak org on iOS. It just so happens the apps offer slightly different targeted experiences. While Beorg is perhaps more geared toward task lists and calendars, Journelly focuses on short and quick notes.

Journelly is still in beta, though lucky for me, [Mac Observer showcased a thorough review](https://www.macobserver.com/tips/round-ups/journelly-journal-app-ios/). If keen to join the beta group, reach out at journelly/./invite/@/xenodium.com or [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xenodium) / [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/xenodium) / [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/xenodium.bsky.social).

P.S. Emacs org continues to be, and likely always will be, my writing epicentre. I now have three revolving [org-based apps on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/xenodium-ltd/id304568690), with Journelly soon to become the fourth one. if interested, check out [my org bundle](the-org-bundle).

[Bemfica de Oliva](https://www.macobserver.com/author/bemfica_deoliva/) does a wonderful rundown of Journelly's features and capabilities, much better than anything else I've posted before. They even mentioned [Org](https://orgmode.org) markup and [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) text editor, for those who want to drop down to its plain text storage. A nice treat, as these aren't typically showcased in the space.

UPDATE: Journelly is [now on the App Store](journelly-like-tweeting-but-for-your-eyes-only).

I've reignited Journelly, my note-taking/journaling project. The iOS app is coming along nicely.

I've been using Journelly daily. The best I can describe the experience is: "kinda like tweeting but for my eyes only".

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/journelly-open-for-beta/journelly.jpeg)

Journelly automatically includes date and time in your entries. Optionally, it'll also include location and weather details.

For now, your entries can include text, images, checkboxes, bullets, and links.

While entering items orally isn't yet possible [as per Irreal's post](https://irreal.org/blog/?p=12842), you can use the standard keyboard button to dictate text.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/journelly-open-for-beta/add.jpeg)

## Powered by plain text (org markup)

If you're an Emacs org mode fan, you'll be happy to know that Journelly stores data as plain text, using org to structure its entries.

If you're unfamiliar with these things, you don't need to learn any of it to use the app. It's just what's under the hood.

# \[2025-03-06 Thu\] DeepSeek, Open Router, Kagi, and Perplexity join the chat

id: deepseek-open-router-kagi-and-perplexity-join-the-chat

Back in November, [I announced the chatgpt-shell Emacs package going offline](deepseek-open-router-kagi-and-perplexity-join-the-chat). In real terms, it meant adding [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) support after [chatgpt-shell went multi-model](chatgpt-shell-goes-multi-model). Since then, support for a handful of providers and models has been added.

While [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/) is the latest joinee, [Open Router](https://openrouter.ai/) (thank you [djr7C4](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/pull/276)), [Kagi summarizer](https://kagi.com/summarizer/index.html), and [Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai/) are also a model-swap away.

[chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell) is [nearing 30K MELPA downloads](https://melpa.org/#/chatgpt-shell). Are you a happy user? Consider making this project sustainable by ✨[sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/xenodium)✨.

# \[2025-02-20 Thu\] Keychron K3 Pro: F1-F12 as default macOS keys
---
id: keychron-k3-pro-f1-f12-as-default-macos-keys
---

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/keychron-k3-pro-f1-f12-as-default-macos-keys/keyboard.jpg)

After resetting my [Keychron K3 Pro](https://www.keychron.uk/products/keychron-k3-pro-qmk-via-wireless-custom-mechanical-keyboard), my F1 to F12 keys were no longer my default macOS keys. The entire row was defaulting to macOS's special keys (i.e. Mission Control, Launch Pad, Volume, etc). At first, I thought I may just need to revisit the macOS setting "Use F1, F2, etc keys as standard function keys", yet toggling the setting made no difference.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/keychron-k3-pro-f1-f12-as-default-macos-keys/settings.png)

Turns out, I had remapped those keys long ago and simply forgot about it. Factory resetting my keyboard got rid of this customization. This post is a reminder for my future self, and anyone else looking to remap their F1-F12 keys.

## Save your current layout

Via <https://usevia.app>, I saved my current keyboard layout (the out-of-box layout) and named it `k3_pro_ansi_white(before).json`.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/keychron-k3-pro-f1-f12-as-default-macos-keys/save.png)

## Apply your changes

I made a second copy of the layout and named it `k3_pro_ansi_white(after).json`. In this new file, I located the two layers (first and second) and simply swapped the two row chunks using a text editor.

The diff looks a little something like this:

## Load your modified layout

Now that we have `k3_pro_ansi_white(after).json` with our changes, all that's left is loading through <https://usevia.app>. You are now done.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/keychron-k3-pro-f1-f12-as-default-macos-keys/load.png)

While F1-F12 keys should now be available by default. To access your macOS special keys use the `fn` key.

Enjoy your F1-F12 default keys!

# \[2025-01-30 Thu\] A tour of Ready Player Mode
---
id: a-tour-of-ready-player-mode
---

[Ready Player Mode](https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player), which began as a [tiny media-viewing experiment](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1dtnjy7/is_there_imageview_but_for_audio/), has now become my daily music player.

Along the way, I moved from regular daily streaming to buying and playing music offline, relying on the odd streaming service exclusively for discovery. This setup's been working great so far. I get unrestricted playback (for life) with the occasional discovery session whenever I see fit.

## Setup

`Ready Player Mode` runs in Emacs. You install it, enable its minor mode (for media recognition), and you're ready to go.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(use-package ready-player
  :ensure t
  :config
  (ready-player-mode +1))
```

`Ready Player Mode` will try to use either [mpv](https://mpv.io/), [vlc](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/), [ffplay](https://ffmpeg.org/ffplay.html), or [mplayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPlayer) (in that order) to play media, but mpv works best.

## Ready to go

Post setup, you can open media files like any other text file and Emacs will just play it for you. Say, open a [dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html) buffer, navigate to a file, and open as usual.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/open-file.gif)

## Buttons vs key bindings

If buttons are your cup of tea, use `tab` or `backtab` to navigate around.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/buttons.gif)

Alternatively, single-key bindings are available. You can find them all in the transient help menu, via the `?` binding.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/transient.png)

## Global key bindings

Global key bindings are available, so you can interact with the player without switching buffers.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/global.png)

Global bindings are under the `C-c m` prefix.

  ----------- -------------------------------------------------------------
  C-c m SPC   Toggle play/stop of media.
  C-c m r     Cycle through repeat settings: file, directory, off.
  C-c m m     Toggle switching between player buffer and previous buffer.
  C-c m s     Toggle shuffle setting.
  C-c m a     Toggle autoplay setting.
  C-c m n     Open the next media file in the same directory.
  C-c m c     Open my media collection.
  C-c m i     Show playback info in the echo area.
  C-c m p     Open the previous media file in the same directory.
  C-c m /     Search the \`dired' playlist for playback (experimental).
  ----------- -------------------------------------------------------------

If you prefer to use other bindings, disable default ones with:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(setq ready-player-set-global-bindings nil)
```

## Open externally

You can always open the currently played file externally, using your system default player. This is bound to the `e` key.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/external.png)

## Repeat, shuffle, and autoplay

Repeat, shuffle, and autoplay should do what you'd expect and can be toggled via `r` `s` and `a` keys.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/repeat-shuffle-autoplay.gif)

## Play current directory

By default, `Ready Player` will continue playing other media found in the current directory. Use `n` and `p` bindings to move through different tracks.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/next.gif)

## Seek

`Ready Player` works best with [mpv](https://mpv.io/) player. If you have it installed, you can seek through tracks.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/seek.gif)

## Play your collection

`Ready Player` can remember your music collection, but needs a tiny addition to the existing setup via the `ready-player-my-media-collection-location` variable.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(use-package ready-player
  :custom
  (ready-player-my-media-collection-location "~/path/to/your/music/collection")
  :config
  (ready-player-mode +1))
```

Your music collection is now available via the home button.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/home.png)

## Index + search

Your music collection is automatically indexed. Same for the currently played directory, so you can search for tracks.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/magnifying.png)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/search.png)

## Bookmarking

This is a new feature inspired by [tristanC's use](https://functional.cafe/@tristanC/113896948267754737) of [Emacs bookmarks](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Bookmarks.html) with `Ready Player.` Bookmarks are now displayed and toggled from the player interface.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/bookmark.gif)

Bookmarks are searchable too.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/search-bookmark.png)

## Download album cover

Missing album cover? Download it via `M-x ready-player-download-album-artwork`.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-tour-of-ready-player-mode/artwork.gif)

## Embracing `dired`

I mentioned playing media from current directory or your music collection, but `Ready Player` is really just playing media from a `dired` buffer. If you can craft a `dired` buffer, `Ready Player` [should be able to play it](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/the-dired-abstraction). Think [find-dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired-and-Find.html).

## Advanced features

`Ready Player` should be umm… ready to play with little configuration. If you want further customizations, check out its [documentation](https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player?tab=readme-ov-file#all-customizations).

Enjoy your unrestricted music offline, now and forever!

# \[2025-01-21 Tue\] A platform that moulds to your needs
---
id: a-platform-that-moulds-to-your-needs
---

Emacs users may be known for bringing in all sorts of diverse workflows into their beloved text editor. From the outside, I get how odd this may seem. We often treat our text editor as a platform of sorts to do our email, web browsing, calendars, project management, chat… the list goes on.

Take email, as an example. Back in 2018 I thought "[managing email from Emacs… surely that's crazy-talk](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/trying-out-mu4e-and-offlineimap)", yet I gave it a try just in case. 7 years later and I never looked back. I still use the excellent [mu4e](https://djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html) client.

As you become more accustomed to Emacs, you may find yourself wishing you could navigate other tasks just as efficiently. But this doesn't happen right away. The editor starts moulding to your needs, initially as you copy others's code/configurations, but this can only take you so far. Emacs truly does mould to your own needs, once you start learning a little [elisp](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/elisp.html).

When comparing `elisp` to modern languages, one may be tempted to dismiss it as a niche language from another era. While both of those things may be true, its moulding and glueing capabilities remain just as relevant and powerful today, even in the [LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) era.

Take a random workflow like extracting vocabulary from a Japanese class paper handout. While it may seem far-fetched for Emacs to handle this, it's actually fairly straightforward with a little elisp glue. Often, this consists of finding some crucial utilities and glueing them up.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-platform-that-moulds-to-your-needs/lookup.gif)

## Take a screenshot

I'm mostly on macOS, so I can use the built-in [screencapture](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102646) utility to capture the screen and save to a file.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(call-process "/usr/sbin/screencapture" nil nil nil "-i" "path/to/screenshot.png")
```

## Get an LLM to OCR things for ya

These days, there are no shortages of neither large language models nor Emacs clients. I built one: [chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell), so I feed the screenshot to `chatgpt-shell-lookup`, giving it a prompt like:

``` org
1. Fill out an org mode table using this format as an example:

|----------+----------+-------+--------+---------+------|
| Hiragana | Katakana | Kanji | Romaji | English | Tags |
|----------+----------+-------+--------+---------+------|
|          |          |       |        |         |      |
|----------+----------+-------+--------+---------+------|

2. Fill out Hiragana or Katakana when appropriate. Never both.
3. Fill out Kanji when appropriate.
4. Show long romaji vowels (i.e. ō).
5. DO NOT use Markdown source blocks.
6. DO NOT add any text or explanations outside the org table.
```

Be sure to always check LLM output ;)

## Let org do its thing

Since I requested [org](https://orgmode.org/) markup from the LLM, I can use `org-mode` to navigate cells and tweak data as needed. The output I get looks a little something like this:

``` org
| Hiragana               | Katakana   | Kanji                | Romaji               | English               | #Tags              |
|------------------------+------------+----------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+--------------------|
| べんきょう を します   |            | 勉強 を します       | benkyō o shimasu     | study                 | #study             |
...
| かいもの を します     |            | 買い物 を します     | kaimono o shimasu    | shop                  | #shopping          |
...
```

## Sarasa Gothic (detour)

More of a side-note than anything… As a beginner Japanese learner, I quickly discovered I needed a font supporting my new rendering needs. I found [Sarasa Gothic Mono](https://picaq.github.io/sarasa/), a lovely font (thanks to this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1hgi7cj/recommendation_for_a_font_for_japanesechinese/)).

## More elisp glue

Now that I got my Japanese vocabulary in org format, I can continue leveraging elisp to glue other things from my target workflow, like iterating over the table and generating a [tsv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) with my new vocabulary:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(while (org-at-table-p)
  (let* ((front ...)
         (hiragana (org-table-get-field 1))
         (katakana (org-table-get-field 2))
         (kanji (org-table-get-field 3))
         (romaji (org-table-get-field 4))
         (meaning (org-table-get-field 5))
         (tags (org-table-get-field 6)))
    (with-current-buffer output-buffer
      (insert (format "%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\n"
                      front
                      hiragana
                      katakana
                      kanji
                      romaji
                      meaning
                      (replace-regexp-in-string "#" "" tags)))))
  (forward-line 1))
```

``` example
べんきょう を します   べんきょう を します     勉強 を します    benkyō o shimasu    study   study
...
かいもの を します    かいもの を します      買い物 を します   kaimono o shimasu   shop    shopping
...
```

## Anki

So where is all this elisp glueing going? Now that I have my new vocabulary in a .tsv table, I can feed it to [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), the popular spaced repetition app. While there are a handful of existing [Anki Emacs packages](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/anki-bookmarks), converting with an elisp loop was simple enough and gave me lots of freedom on how to structure my cards.

## iPhone

Once I got the new vocabulary imported into Anki, I can subsequently sync it over to the iPhone. In some way, you can say that a bit of elisp glue here and there facilitated the entire workflow.

By the way, now you know why there's a random [chatgpt-shell-japanese-lookup](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/blob/9c896feda89a2a879de807a5bd652beec7d6a3f6/chatgpt-shell.el#L1896) function included in [chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-platform-that-moulds-to-your-needs/anki.jpeg)

## Learn elisp

While Emacs and elisp may not be the most fashionable pair, they sure fill a huge void for me. They provide a platform that can easily mould to my specific needs.

If you're an Emacser and have been shying away from learning elisp, do yourself a favour and get your toes dipped. You'll be glad to.

Soon enough, you'll enable workflows that mould exactly to the way you like things to work. In other words, they simply [do what ✨you✨ mean](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/emacs-dwim-do-what-i-mean) ;)

# \[2025-01-01 Wed\] Blogging minus the yucky bits of the modern web
---
id: blogging-minus-the-yucky-bits-of-modern-web
---

Happy New Year! If you follow [my blog](https://lmno.lol/alvaro), you may have noticed that I've been hosting it on [lmno.lol](https://lmno.lol) for a while now, a blogging service I built (invitation-only until now).

[![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/blogging-minus-the-yucky-bits-of-modern-web/lmno.png)](https://lmno.lol)

## Why build a blogging platform

There's been a resurgence in blogging of sorts. Wonderful in itself, but the popular platforms are fairly erm unfriendly to their readers.

These days, search results might lead you to an interesting blog post, but you're greeted with messages like:

> “The author made this story available to \^\^\^\^\^\^ members only. If you’re new to \^\^\^\^\^\^, create a new account to read this story on us.”

Kinda strange for a platform to offload blame onto its users.

In one instance, I bit the bullet. Created an account, logged in, only to find out the specific post was reserved to paying members. “Alright,” I thought, “let’s do this.” Sadly, when I finally arrived, the content was a bit of a letdown. After all those hoops…

Meanwhile, both [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/) and [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) were going haywire. Great, this thing is tracking me too. At least the site is lean… I kid, of course not.

So that's that. Off I went to build a blogging platform to exclude the yucky bits the modern web has brought to our blogs.

## My blogging journey

I'm what you may call an accidental blogger. Sometime ago, I started jotting notes using plain text file sprinkled with [org markup](https://orgmode.org/). I'd use my [text editor](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) for both writing and recall. It worked well when in front of my computer, not so much when on the move or sharing things with anyone. By that point, I decided to export my notes to HTML and post online. Over time, folks started reaching out about something read in my notes, errrm blog posts, and so by then I suppose I had become a blogger.

In 11 years of blogging, my approach hasn't changed much. I still write to the very same plain text file I used to write my notes to. I found this approach fairly accessible, with little ceremony. When I want to write, I open the usual text file and just write. HTML exporting consisted of hacky [elisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp) cobbled together over time. While the code was nothing to rave about, it did the job just fine over the years. Having said that, it was more of a "it works on my machine" sorta thing.

## Enter lmno.lol

[lmno.lol](https://lmno.lol) is heavily inspired by the same workflow. You write your notes or blog posts to a single plain text file, sprinkling [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) this time around, and just drag and drop it to the web.

`lmno.lol` takes care of the rest.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/blogging-minus-the-yucky-bits-of-modern-web/demo.gif)

## A Little blast from the past

Remember [ASCII art](https://www.asciiart.eu/)? [Figlet](http://www.figlet.org/)? You can bring back some of that nostalgic web by adding a banner to your blog.

Some time ago, I wrote about [adding multiple cursor support to symbol-overlay](its-all-up-for-grabs-and-it-compounds/) by gluing the two packages together. If you're keen to learn how to bend Emacs to your way, have a look at that post.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/its-all-up-for-grabs-and-it-compounds/symbol-overlay-meets-multiple-cursors.gif)

Later on, in a "Multiple cursors - how and why?" [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1h321x2/multiple_cursors_how_and_why), I showcased the overlay usage. [Peter Oliver](https://www.mavit.org.uk) asked [if the package could be submitted to MELPA](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1h321x2/comment/m06x676/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). To my delight, he also volunteered to [take on the submission](https://github.com/melpa/melpa/pull/9267).

Unfortunately, I had failed to check back on the MELPA submission until today. I'm happy to report that, thanks to Peter, `symbol-overlay-mc` [is now on MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/symbol-overlay-mc).

A few days ago, [Sacha Chua](https://sachachua.com/blog/) mentioned how [cool it would be to have an Emacs video index](https://social.sachachua.com/@sacha/statuses/01JF94JQQNNRXMTKN3Y1774TFP) like [Ruby Video](https://www.rubyvideo.dev/topics). I mentioned how I had similarly considered a low-tech solution, maybe powered by plain text (bonus points for [org mode](https://orgmode.org/) of course).

A little later, Sacha [shared a preliminary video feed dump](https://social.sachachua.com/@sacha/statuses/01JFG5T3C6E88362DRDZN9ANA6), in org! With that, I wrote the [first experiment to render the org feed](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium/113682069315989397) and [emacs.tv](https://emacs.tv/) was born.

[emacs.tv](https://emacs.tv/) is merely a few days old. Powered by an org feed (rendered client-side), but we can fetch and render in all sorts of ways. [emacs.tv](https://emacs.tv/) brings it to the web, though I'm sure we can come up with all sorts of Emacs integrations. A new major mode?

# \[2024-12-09 Mon\] An experimental (e)shell pager
---
id: an-experimental-e-shell-pager
---

These days, my LLM interactions primarily take place via [chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell)'s compose UX. I've grown fond of this hybrid style of interaction. On sharing the [latest incarnation](https://bsky.app/profile/xenodium.bsky.social/post/3lco3ggkk4c2r), [jllw](https://bsky.app/profile/jllw.bsky.social) asked about the possibility to [port to comint shells](https://bsky.app/profile/jllw.bsky.social/post/3lcpb6ygkws2v).

With [jllw](https://bsky.app/profile/jllw.bsky.social)'s great idea in mind, I set out to prototype an [eshell](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html) pager, my preferred shell.

The initial results ain't too shabby:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/an-experimental-e-shell-pager/shell-pager.gif)

While you can easily flip through all `eshell` commands and outputs (via single-character n/p bindings), you can also compose and fire off new commands using a magit-style approach. That is, craft your desired command and C-c C-c to send it off.

The prototype is currently focused on `eshell`, but it can be easily ported to [comint](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shell-Mode.html) and other shells by writing new `shell-maker` configs:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(shell-pager--make-config
 :shell-buffer buffer
 :page-buffer (shell-pager--buffer)
 :next #'shell-pager--eshell-next
 :previous #'shell-pager--eshell-previous
 :current #'shell-pager--eshell-current-item
 :subscribe #'shell-pager--eshell-subscribe
 :unsubscribe #'shell-pager--eshell-unsubscribe
 :submit #'shell-pager--eshell-submit
 :interrupt #'shell-pager--eshell-interrupt)
```

`shell-pager`'s super [rough/experimental code is now on GitHub](https://github.com/xenodium/shell-pager).

It's been a fun experiment so far. Time will tell, whether or not `shell-pager` can replace most of my `eshell` interactions. The good news is that this isn't an all or nothing sorta thing. `shell-pager` complements `eshell`, so I can always jump back to eshell itself and continue with the very same shell history.

# \[2024-12-05 Thu\] LLM chat navigation
---
id: llm-chat-navigation
---

LLM chats are often handy for refining answers to a question or task, part of a bigger goal. Navigating the chat transcript, copying and pasting, can be a frequent operation in the bigger goal. If we can do it more efficiently, the better.

While [chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/issues) offered `chatgpt-shell-next-item` and `chatgpt-shell-previous-item` commands, it had a few rough edges which prevented me from fully adopting. The default bindings `C-c C-n` and `C-c C-p` didn't exactly help either, making repeated navigation fairly clunky. [repeat-mode](https://karthinks.com/software/it-bears-repeating/) would have helped a little, yet I was yearning for a familiar experience… more like `tab` and `Shift-tab` in web browsers.

While shells often `tab`-complete commands and/or arguments, I'm not super convinced `tab` completion is a good candidate for an LLM Emacs shell. Having said that, searching for previous prompts a la `Ctr-r` is indeed a handy feature and already supported in [chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/issues) (via `M-r`).

This is all to say that the with the latest `chatgpt-shell` navigation changes (using `<tab>` and `<backtab>` bindings), the `chatgpt-shell` experience feels way more natural. You can see it in action…

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/llm-chat-navigation/shell.gif)

Tab navigation jumps between prompts, links, and code blocks. You may have noticed code blocks are automatically selected, in case you want to quickly copy and paste elsewhere.

This mode of navigation is also present in the [compose UX](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/chatgpt-shell-goes-multi-model#a-shell-hybrid) (via M-x `chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose`). In addition to `<tab>` and `<backtab>`, you can use `n` and `p` bindings (post prompt submission).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/llm-chat-navigation/compose-tab.gif)

Give the new navigation a try. See how it feels. Some of it is fairly fresh, so [please file bugs if needed](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/issues/new).

# \[2024-12-04 Wed\] Awesome elisp

A few days ago, redditor [gollyned](https://www.reddit.com/user/gollyned) asked about [best practices: developing on top of modern elisp packages](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1h4eos1/best_practices_developing_on_top_of_modern_elisp/). It reminded of my [modern Emacs lisp libraries](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/modern-elisp-libraries) post, which I shared with them.

While my post is roughly 4.5 years old, these days I continue to reach out to the likes of [seq.el](https://nicolas.petton.fr/ressources/emacsconf2015/), [map.el](https://nicolas.petton.fr/ressources/emacsconf2015/), [subr-x.el](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/emacs-lisp/subr-x.el) and [let-alist.el](https://endlessparentheses.com/new-on-elpa-and-in-emacs-25-1-let-alist.html) on a regular basis. My post also [shared some great third party options](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/modern-elisp-libraries). Maybe my post could use an update? Happy to take suggestions.

A few days later, I ran into [awesome-elisp](https://github.com/p3r7/awesome-elisp), which aggregates a ton of resources to check out. Funnily enough, [I had bookmarked it a long while ago](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/emacs-lisp-bookmarks) and simply forgot about it. On a somewhat related note, when I reviewed my old list of bookmarks, I didn't have Yoo Box's [it is not hard to read Lisp code](https://yoo2080.wordpress.com/2014/07/04/it-is-not-hard-to-read-lisp-code/) bookmarked, which changed the way I viewed and read elisp code (spoiler alert, as a tree). I remember how well this approach also translated to languages like Objective-C, enabling me to inline more things without worrying too much.

In any case, the [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1h4eos1/best_practices_developing_on_top_of_modern_elisp/) was another reminder for me to go and check out some of those bookmarks I never got to read, including the [awesome-elisp](https://github.com/p3r7/awesome-elisp) one.

# \[2024-11-27 Wed\] ob-chatgpt-shell goes multi-model too
---
id: ob-chatgpt-shell-goes-multi-model-too
---

A week ago, I announced [chatgpt-shell going multi-model](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/chatgpt-shell-goes-multi-model). What I failed to mention is that because [ob-chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/ob-chatgpt-shell) (its [org babel](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html) Emacs cousin) relies on `chatgpt-shell`, this `babel` package has now gone multi-model also.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/ob-chatgpt-shell-goes-multi-model-too/babel-multi-model.gif)

`ob-chatgpt-shell` follows the familiar babel form. To swap models, use the existing `:version` param as follows.

``` org
#+begin_src chatgpt-shell :results output :version gpt-4o
  Who built you?
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: I was developed by OpenAI, a research organization focused on creating and promoting friendly AI for the benefit of all humanity.

#+begin_src chatgpt-shell :results output :version claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
  Who built you?
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: I was created by Anthropic.

#+begin_src chatgpt-shell :results output :version qwen2.5-coder
  Who built you?
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

  Who built you?
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: I was built by Google.  More specifically, I'm a large language model, trained by Google.
```

Keep in mind that `:version` depends on `chatgpt-shell-models` to resolve its models. You may need to add other models. If you add new ones, consider contributing a [pull request](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/pulls), so we all benefit from the addition.

## Should [ob-chatgpt-shell](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/chatgpt-shell-goes-multi-model#should-chatgpt-shell-rename%3F) rename?

See [this](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/chatgpt-shell-goes-multi-model#should-chatgpt-shell-rename%3F).

## Please report issues

In addition to being a fairly new feature, `chatgpt-shell` multi-model support required quite a few structural changes. We may still need additional polishing follow-ups. If you encounter any issues [please report them](https://github.com/xenodium/ob-chatgpt-shell/issues/new).

## Make this project sustainable

Maintaining, experimenting, implementing feature requests, and supporting open-source packages takes work.

# \[2024-11-25 Mon\] LLM iterate and insert
---
id: llm-iterate-and-insert
---

[chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell) includes a couple of mechanisms to operate on an Emacs buffer region. That is, select a region and ask the [LLM robots](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/chatgpt-shell-goes-multi-model) to modify it for us. Until now, both of these mechanisms didn't quite close the loop. They could either modify current region or iterate on a separate solution, but never both.

## M-x chatgpt-shell-quick-insert

While `chatgpt-shell`'s quick insert mechanism already enabled selecting a region and requesting changes, it was more of a "I'm feeling lucky" situation. If the changes didn't pan out, you'd have to discard the suggestion and start over.

With the latest changes, in addition to accepting or discarding (y/n bindings) suggestions, we can now iterate using the `i` binding.

![](http://localhost:8787/alvaro/llm-iterate-and-insert/quick-insert-iterate.gif "1")

## M-x chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose

While quick insertions rely on minibuffer input, `chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose` opens a dedicated buffer for a more thorough interactions. Select a region, invoke `chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose` (my preferred binding being `C-c C-e`), and a new compose buffer is created with the region text. Add your instructions and submit with `C-c C-c`. Post submission, the compose buffer becomes read-only and single-character key-bindings take over. For example: `r` replies (for further iteration) and `n/p` (or `TAB/shift-TAB`) navigation. There are [more bindings](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell?tab=readme-ov-file#a-shell-hybrid).

Until now, we could easily craft more involved queries and continue iterating from the compose buffer, but integrating suggested changes was a manual process. That is, navigate to a code block, select, copy it and then paste it elsewhere.

With the latest changes, pressing `i` (insert) while on a code block will attempt to insert it wherever the initial interaction took place.

![](http://localhost:8787/alvaro/llm-iterate-and-insert/compose-insert-iterate.gif "1")

Both of these changes show now be available on MELPA. While I demoed ChatGPT, the two mechanism should now work with any of the supported models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Ollama).

# \[2024-11-22 Fri\] Toggle macOS menu bar from you know where
---
id: toggle-macos-menu-bar-from-you-know-where
---

I'm a fan of macOS's auto-hide menu bar setting. Unless I'm reaching out to a menu item, I don't typically need to have a visible menu bar, so I set auto-hide to "Always".

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/toggle-macos-menu-bar-from-you-know-where/control-center.png)

On rare occasions, I turn this setting off (say [for a screen grab](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/chatgpt-shell-goes-offline)). While reaching out to macOS Control Center is OK, I wanted to quickly toggle it from the comfort of Emacs via `M-x` fuzzy search.

We can leverage AppleScript to toggle the setting on and off. In the past, I would write shell scripts for this kinda thing and invoke from the command line. These days, I dump them into a [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) and quickly forget about its implementation. From then on, I just M-x and fuzzy search for some magical incantation (I'm looking at you ffmpeg). I got [a bunch of these things](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command?tab=readme-ov-file#my-toolbox)…

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-commands-macos-toggle-menu-bar-autohide ()
  "Toggle macOS menu bar auto-hide."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   "Toggle menu bar auto-hide."
   "current_status=$(osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to get autohide menu bar of dock preferences')

if [ \"$current_status\" = \"true\" ]; then
    osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to set autohide menu bar of dock preferences to false'
    echo \"Auto-hide disabled.\"
else
    osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to set autohide menu bar of dock preferences to true'
    echo \"Auto-hide enabled.\"

id: chatgpt-shell-goes-offline

Since [chatgpt-shell going multi-model](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/chatgpt-shell-goes-multi-model), it was only a matter of time until we added support for local/offline models. As of version 2.0.6, [chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell) has a basic [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) implementation (llama3.2 for now).

`chatgpt-shell` is more than a shell. Check out the [demos in the previous post](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/chatgpt-shell-goes-multi-model).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chatgpt-shell-goes-offline/who-offline.gif)

For anyone keen on keeping all their LLM interactions offline, Ollama seems like a great option. I'm an Ollama noobie myself and already looking forward to getting acquainted. Having an offline LLM available at my Emacs fingertips will be super convenient.

For the more familiar with Ollama, please give the [chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell) integration a try (it's on [MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/chatgpt-shell)).

v2.0.6 has a basic/inital Ollama implementation. Please give it a good run and [report bugs](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/issues/new).

# \[2024-11-20 Wed\] chatgpt-shell goes multi-model
---
id: chatgpt-shell-goes-multi-model
---

Over the last few months, I've been chipping at implementing [chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell)'s most requested and biggest feature: multi-model support. Today, I get to unveil the first two implementations: [Anthropic's Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) and [Google's Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/main/demos/multi-model-shell.gif" width="99%" />

## Changing course

In the past, I envisioned a different path for multi-model support. By isolating shell logic into a new package ([shell-maker](https://github.com/xenodium/shell-maker)), folks could use it as a [building block to create new shells](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/a-shell-maker) (adding support for their favourite LLM).

While each shell-maker-based shell currently shares a basic common experience, I did not foresee the minor differences affecting the general Emacs user experience. Learning the quirks of each new shell felt like unnecessary friction in developing muscle memory. I also became dependent on `chatgpt-shell` features, which I often missed when using other shells.

Along with slightly different shell experiences, we currently require multiple package installations (and setups). Depending on which camp you're on (batteries included vs fine-grained control) this may or may not be a downside.

With every new `chatgpt-shell` feature I showcased, I was often asked if they could be used with other LLM providers. I typically answered with "I've been meaning to work on this…" or "I heard you can do multi-model `chatgpt-shell` using a bridge like [liteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/)". Neither of these where great answers, resulting in me just postponing the chunky work.

Eventually, I bit the bullet, changed course, and got to work on multi-model support. With my initial plan to spin multiple shells via `shell-maker`, `chatgpt-shell`'s implementation didn't exactly lend itself to support multiple clients. Long story short, `chatgpt-shell` multi-model support required quite a bit of work. This where I divert to ask you to [help make this project sustainable by sponsoring the work](https://github.com/sponsors/xenodium).

## chatgpt-shell, more than a shell

With chatgpt-shell being a [comint](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shell-Prompts.html) shell, you can bring your favourite Emacs flows along.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/main/demos/cyberpunk.gif" width="99%" />

As I used `chatgpt-shell` myself, I kept experimenting with different integrations and improvements. Read on for some of my favourites…

### A shell hybrid

`chatgpt-shell` includes a compose buffer experience. This is my favourite and most frequently used mechanism to interact with LLMs.

For example, select a region and invoke `M-x chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose` (`C-c C-e` is my preferred binding), and an editable buffer automatically copies the region and enables crafting a more thorough query. When ready, submit with the familiar `C-c C-c` binding. The buffer automatically becomes read-only and enables single-character bindings.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/main/demos/compose.gif" width="99%" />

### Navigation: n/p (or TAB/shift-TAB)

Navigate through source blocks (including previous submissions in history). Source blocks are automatically selected.

### Reply: r

Reply with with follow-up requests using the `r` binding.

### Give me more: m

Want to ask for more of the same data? Press `m` to request more of it. This is handy to follow up on any kind of list (suggestion, candidates, results, etc).

### Request entire snippets: e

LLM being lazy and returning partial code? Press `e` to request entire snippet.

### Quick quick: q

I'm a big fan of quickly disposing of Emacs buffers with the `q` binding. chatgpt-shell compose buffers are no exception.

## Confirm inline mods (via diffs)

Request inline modifications, with explicit confirmation before accepting.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/main/demos/quick-insert.gif" width="99%" />

## Execute snippets (a la [org babel](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html))

Both the shell and the compose buffers enable users to execute source blocks via `C-c C-c`, leveraging [org babel](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/main/demos/swiftui.gif" width="99%" />

## Vision experiments

I've been experimenting with image queries (currently ChatGPT only, please [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/xenodium) to help bring support for others).

Below is a handy integration to extract Japanese vocabulary. There's also a generic image descriptor available via `M-x chatgpt-shell-describe-image` that works on any Emacs image (via dired, image buffer, point on image, or selecting a desktop region).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/main/demos/japanese-weekdays.gif" width="99%" />

## Supporting new models

Your favourite model not yet supported? File a [feature request](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/issues/new). You also know how to [fuel the project](https://github.com/sponsors/xenodium). Want to contribute new models? [Reach out](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/issues/new).

## Local models

While the two new implementations rely on cloud APIs, local services are now possible. I've yet to use a local LLM, but please [reach out](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/issues/new), so we can make these happen too. Want to contribute?

## Should chatgpt-shell rename?

With `chatgpt-shell` going multi-model, it's not unreasonable to ask if this package should be renamed. Maybe it should. But that's additional work we can likely postpone for the time being (and avoid pushing users to migrate). For now, I'd prefer focusing on polishing the multi-model experience and work on ironing out any issues. For that, I'll need your help.

## Take Gemini and Claude for a spin

Multi-model support required chunky structural changes. While I've been using it myself, I'll need wider usage to uncover issues. Please take it for a spin and [file bugs or give feedback](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/issues/new). Or if you just want to ping me, I'd love to hear about your experience ([Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xenodium) / [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/xenodium) / [Email](mailto:me__AT__xenodium.com)).

-   Be sure to update to `chatgpt-shell` v2.0.1 and `shell-maker` v0.68.1 as a minimum.
-   Set `chatgpt-shell-anthropic-key` or `chatgpt-shell-google-key`.
-   Swap models with existing `M-x chatgpt-shell-swap-model-version` or set a default with `(setq chatgpt-shell-model-version "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620")` or `(setq chatgpt-shell-model-version "claude-gemini-1.5-pro-latest")`.
-   Everything else should just work 🤞😅

Happy Emacsing!

# \[2024-11-13 Wed\] chatgpt-shell splits up
---
id: chatgpt-shell-repo-splits-up
---

The [chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell) package started as an experiment [glueing the ChatGPT API to an Emacs comint buffer](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/a-chatgpt-emacs-shell). Over time, it grew into several packages within the same repository: shell-maker, ob-chatgpt-shell, dall-e-shell, ob-dall-e-shell, and of course chatgpt-shell itself.

I'm splitting the repository as a first step in reworking `chatgpt-shell` to enable multi-model support (i.e. Gemini, Claude, and others), a popular feature request.

## Want multi-model support?

Go 👍 the [feature request](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/issues/244) and ✨[sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/xenodium)✨ the work.

If keen on having a multi-modal `chatgpt-shell` at your fingertips, please consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/xenodium) to make the project sustainable. Improvements like this, integrations, and keeping up with the AI space takes quite a bit of work and effort.

## New package repositories

### chatgpt-shell

No repo location changes. Remains at <https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell>

`chatgpt-shell` carries the ChatGPT shell itself, but also convenience integrations.

My hope is to make this a multi-model package.

### ob-chatgpt-shell

Moves to <https://github.com/xenodium/ob-chatgpts-shell>

An extension of `chatgpt-shell` to execute org babel blocks as ChatGPT prompts.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chatgpt-shell-repo-splits-up/ob-chatgpt-shell.png)

### dall-e-shell

Moves to <https://github.com/xenodium/dall-e-shell>

A dedicated shell for DALL-E image generation.

# \[2024-10-21 Mon\] Hide another detail
---
id: hide-another-detail
---

It's been 5 years since I talked about [showing/hiding Emacs dired details in style](showhide-emacs-dired-details-in-style/), a short post showcasing [hide-details-mode](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Misc-Dired-Features.html) (built-in) and [diredfl](https://github.com/purcell/diredfl) (third-party).

While my dired usage increased over the years, my dired config remained largely unchanged. Today, I'll show a new dired tweak.

As you likely suspect by now, I'm a big fan of [hide-details-mode](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Misc-Dired-Features.html). It gives me super clean and minimalistic view of my files.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/hide-another-detail/before.png)

If I need more details, it's one toggle away using my trusty C-( binding.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/hide-another-detail/toggle-before.gif)

Now this is a super minor thing, but for a little while, I wished I could also hide the current directory's absolute path as part of `hide-details-mode`'s toggling. In the same spirit as other hidden dired details, I rarely need to see the absolute path. And if I did, it'd only be a toggle away.

With that in mind, I set out to bend dired my way. I looked at the `dired-hide-details-mode` built-in code (dired.el) and came across invisibility specs, which I hadn't used before. Dired uses `add-to-invisibility-spec` and `remove-from-invisibility-spec` to show and hide details using the `invisible` property set to `dired-hide-details-information`.

Now that we know what property to set, we need to find the text to apply it to. Dired offers that via `dired-subdir-regexp`. All we need to do is match the regular expression and apply our invisible property to the relevant bounds.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun hide-dired-details-include-all-subdir-paths ()
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (while (re-search-forward dired-subdir-regexp nil t)
      (let* ((match-bounds (cons (match-beginning 1) (match-end 1)))
             (path (file-name-directory (buffer-substring (car match-bounds)
                                                          (cdr match-bounds))))
             (path-start (car match-bounds))
             (path-end (+ (car match-bounds) (length path)))
             (inhibit-read-only t))
        (put-text-property path-start path-end
                           'invisible 'dired-hide-details-information)))))
```

All that's left is for us to add our new function to a hook, and we're good to go.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(use-package dired
  :hook ((dired-mode . dired-hide-details-mode)
         (dired-after-readin . hide-dired-details-include-all-subdir-paths)))
```

My Dired window is even cleaner now. The current directory's absolute path is now hidden.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/hide-another-detail/after.png)

There may be times we need to peek at the absolute path. We can now toggle hiding this detail just like the others.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/hide-another-detail/toggle-after.gif)

## My first Emacs patch

While this is a rather small change, I figured I could use it to get my toes dipped as a first Emacs contribution. I've since reworked the patch to fit into dired.el's code and submitted for review.

I'm happy to report the tiny feature's now merged to master as of [a couple of days ago](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=7cbca90569472af5643905fca5b7ab2dea67f876). Yay! 🎉

It'll be sometime until the feature makes it to a release, but if you're living on the Emacs master edge, it should be available there. While the feature is disabled by default, it can enabled with:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(setq dired-hide-details-hide-absolute-location t)
```

Happy hiding!

# \[2024-09-21 Sat\] How I batch apply and save one-liners
---
id: how-i-batch-apply-and-save-one-liners
---

My significant other needed to share proof of address by providing a number of bank statements for a period of time. That's easy enough to download as pdfs from the bank, but statements typically provide more personal information than the recipient requires. For a proof of address, the first page is more than enough.

macOS's Preview app can easily delete pages from a pdf by selecting undesired pages and hitting the delete key. This is fine for one pdf but for a handful of them, I figured there's a command line incantation I could use out there, and indeed there is:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
qpdf my.pdf --pages . 1 -- my-one-page.pdf
```

With command in mind, I resorted to my now my typical approach of:

-   Convert to a generic [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command).
-   Batch apply.

I could be done at this point, but since I now have the command fresh in mind…

-   Save command for future usage.

So let's get on with it.

## Converting to dwim-shell-command

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
qpdf '<<f>>' --pages . 1 -- '<<fne>>_1.<<e>>'
```

## Batch apply

Other than show it in action, it may be worth mentioning dwim-shell-command recognizes files in region (in addition to dired's mark of course), so you can just select and apply.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-batch-apply-and-save-one-liners/keep-1-page.gif)

## Save for future usage

Saving these commands for future usage typically consists of merely wrapping in an Emacs command so we can invoke via M-x (and your favorite narrowing framework for that fuzzy quick magic).

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-commands-keep-pdf-page ()
  "Keep a page from pdf."
  (interactive)
  (let ((page-num (read-number "Keep page number: " 1)))
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "Keep pdf page"
     (format "qpdf '<<f>>' --pages . %d -- '<<fne>>_%d.<<e>>'" page-num page-num)
     :utils "qpdf")))
```

For this instance, there's a tiny bit of additional logic to ask the user which page they'd like to keep.

While there's no way I'll remember `qpdf my.pdf --pages . 1 -- my-one-page.pdf`, I can easily find it in the future by searching with something like `M-x keep page`.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-batch-apply-and-save-one-liners/keep-1-page-command.gif)

## My toolbox

I've saved a bunch of these commands and use many of them regularly. You can find in the [optional component of dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command?tab=readme-ov-file#my-toolbox).

# \[2024-09-19 Thu\] Emacs bubble mode
---
id: emacs-bubble-mode
---

From time to time, I want to grab a source code viewport of sorts and feed to an LLM for questioning. From Emacs, I normally use [chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell)'s `chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose`, which automatically grabs the active region. This led me to explore a few options to select a region, or maybe even roll my own. I should also mention, these regions don't typically require compilable/complete structures.

In most of these instances, I just reach out to one of my region favourites like [expand-region](https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el), `mark-defun`, or `mark-whole-buffer`. Alternatively, I navigate to different points using sexp commands like `backward-sexp` and `forward-sexp` (or maybe something like `sp-backward-up-sexp` from [smartparens](https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens)), using `set-mark-command` in-between to activate the region.

While these commands typically yield balanced expressions, it's often unnecessary for my LLM queries. This led me to [ask folks](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium/113158018599745252) for different ways of selecting regions, which highlighted great package suggestions like [avy](https://github.com/abo-abo/avy), [meow](https://github.com/meow-edit), and [easy-kill](https://github.com/leoliu/easy-kill).

While I've been intrigued by `meow`'s modal editing for some time, I'm not ready for that fair trial jump. Will have to postpone it for a little longer.

`Easy-kill` offers `easy-mark`, in some ways similar to the built-in `mark-sexp`, but with additional marking heuristics and possibly other goodies I missed. At present, I get similar benefits from the likes of `expand-region` and the other sexp helpers.

`Avy`'s `avy-kill-ring-save-region` could work for my purpose, though I wish it left the region active. Maybe that's already possible? I could look into extending `avy`, though [Christian's suggestions](https://mastodon.social/@ctietze/113154167264208507) led me to lean more on visual feedback in my own region-expanding experiments.

The goal was to enable extending regions in both vertical directions by simultaneously adding lines at both ends. Sure, this doesn't guarantee structural completeness, but it may just be enough for my LLM-feeding purpose. Maybe this already exists in the Emacs universe, but hey, it's an excuse to throw some elisp lines together…

Assuming there's an existing active region, expanding in both directions is pretty straightforward.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun bubble-expand()
  "Expand region."
  (interactive)
  (when (> (point) (mark))
    (exchange-point-and-mark))
  (forward-line -1)
  (exchange-point-and-mark)
  (forward-line 1)
  (exchange-point-and-mark))

(defun bubble-shrink ()
  "Shrink region."
  (interactive)
  (when (< (point) (mark))
    (exchange-point-and-mark))
  (forward-line -1)
  (exchange-point-and-mark)
  (forward-line 1))
```

While I've yet to use this region-expanding approach long enough to validate its usefulness, it sure is fun to play with it.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-bubble-mode/bubble-expand-shrink.gif)

This got me thinking, what other funky things I could do with the region? Could I shift the region selection like a viewport of sorts? As you now expect, the answer in Emacs is almost always of course we can…

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun bubble-shift-up ()
  "Shift the region up by one line."
  (interactive)
  (when (> (point) (mark))
    (exchange-point-and-mark))
  (forward-line -1)
  (forward-line 0)
  (exchange-point-and-mark)
  (forward-line -1)
  (end-of-line)
  (activate-mark)
  (exchange-point-and-mark))

(defun bubble-shift-down ()
  "Shift the region down by one line."
  (interactive)
  (when (> (point) (mark))
    (exchange-point-and-mark))
  (forward-line)
  (forward-line 0)
  (exchange-point-and-mark)
  (forward-line)
  (end-of-line)
  (activate-mark)
  (exchange-point-and-mark))
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-bubble-mode/bubble-shift.gif)

My friend Vaarnan also suggested looking into UX around providing line count, which is possible by providing a prefix into `bubble-expand-region`.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
C-5 M-x bubble-expand-region
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-bubble-mode/bubble-number.gif)

These commands alone aren't as effective unless we have some key-bindings around them. I've tied things up into a minor mode, called… you guessed it: `bubble-mode`. Oooh, a mode, you may say it's now official ;) Well, no. It's still an experiment of sorts and currently lives in [my Emacs config repo](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/ar/bubble.el).

The key bindings I've chosen are:

-   `C-c C-w`: Enter bubble-mode.
-   `C-p`: bubble-expand.
-   `C-n`: bubble-shrink.
-   `S-C-p`: bubble-move-up.
-   `S-C-n`: bubble-move-down.
-   `Numbers 1-0`: Expand 1 to 10 lines.
-   `RET`: Exit bubble-mode.

Note: Inspired by expand-region, any other key binding/command automatically exits `bubble-mode`.

`C-c C-w` kinda works for me as `C-c w` is already bound to `expand-region`. Let's see if that sticks, though I may have to give up the `org-refile` binding.

So does it work for my original LLM intent? We shall see, but it seems to so far. You can play with it if you'd like (it's on [github](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/ar/bubble.el)). Here's what that flow now looks like:

# \[2024-09-11 Wed\] Spiffing up those echo messages
---
id: spiffing-up-those-echo-messages
---

Well-ingrained into every Emacs user is the echo area, a one-stop shop to receive any kind of message from the editor, located at the bottom of the frame. Posting messages to this area from elisp couldn't be simpler:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(message "Hello world")
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/spiffing-up-those-echo-messages/svg-hello-world.gif)

If we want to get a little fancier, we can propertize the text to add some styling.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(message (propertize "hello " 'face '(:foreground "#C3E88D"))
         (propertize "world" 'face '(:foreground "#FF5370")))
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/spiffing-up-those-echo-messages/svg-hello-world-colors.gif)

With this in mind, I set out to add a tiny command to [ready-player](https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player).

I wanted the ability to ask what's on without switching to another buffer. The echo area is perfect for that. It should display track title, artist, and album.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(message (concat "Ahead " ;; title
                 (propertize "Wire " 'face '(:foreground "#C3E88D")) ;; artist
                 (propertize "The Ideal Copy" 'face '(:foreground "#FF5370")))) ;; album
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/spiffing-up-those-echo-messages/svg-ready-player-colors.gif)

This kinda works, but I wasn't convinced with the styling. Maybe I need multi-line?

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(message (concat "Ahead\n" ;; title
                 (propertize "Wire\n" 'face '(:foreground "#C3E88D")) ;; artist
                 (propertize "The Ideal Copy" 'face '(:foreground "#FF5370")))) ;; album

I felt something was missing. If I could just add the album artwork as a thumbnail… The ideal layout would maybe look something like:

    +-------+
    |       | Ahead
    | image | Wire
    |       | The Ideal Copy
    +-------+

While the text-everywhere nature of Emacs buffers has many advantages, building more involved layouts can have its challenges. But hey, for that simple read-only message we're aiming at, we can certainly get creative without too much trouble. You see, Emacs has native svg support, so we can craft our fancy layout in elisp and tell Emacs to render it for us.

While I'm a noob at doing anything in svg from Emacs, adding an image and three labels, really isn't that difficult.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(message
 (let* ((image-width 90)
        (image-height 90)
        (text-height 25)
        (svg (svg-create (frame-pixel-width) image-height)))
   (svg-embed svg "path/to/thumbnail.png"
              "image/png" nil
              :x 0 :y 0 :width image-width :height image-height)
   (svg-text svg "Ahead"
             :x (+ image-width 10) :y text-height
             :fill (face-attribute 'default :foreground))
   (svg-text svg "Wire"
             :x (+ image-width 10) :y (* 2 text-height)
             :fill "#C3E88D")
   (svg-text svg "The Ideal Copy" :x (+ image-width 10) :y (* 3 text-height)
             :fill "#FF5370")
   (with-temp-buffer
     (svg-insert-image svg)
     (buffer-string))))
```

The code is fairly self-explanatory. While there may be an even simpler way (please lemme know), I used a temporary buffer to embed the svg in the propertized text prior to feeding to the handy `message` function.

…and with that, we get a richer display of the current track.

While I haven't experimented with other ways of creating multi-column layouts in Emacs (including images), [I'd love to know](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium) if there's anything else available besides svg.

# \[2024-09-07 Sat\] Seek and you shall find
---
id: seek-and-you-shall-find
---

A couple of months ago, I [introduced Ready Player Mode](ready-player-mode/), an Emacs major mode used to peek at media files from my beloved text editor. The goal was simple. Treat opening media files like any other file, that is, open and go.

The initial implementation served me well while reviewing lots of tiny audio files I used to practice learning a new language. At this point, I started thinking, could I use ready-player for regular music consumption? The thing is, long ago I had stopped buying music and relied on streamed music from online services. Could I go back to offline?

Dusting off my old media collection brought lots of memories as I rediscovered tunes. Having said that, the ready-player experience wasn't quite cutting it for an extended listening experience. I no longer wanted to occasionally peek at media to learn a language. I wanted to load a full music collection. I wanted random access to everything. I wanted Emacs to remember what I was listening to across sessions… While I did [add some pluggable flows](the-dired-abstraction/), I still needed additional changes to make the experience more pleasant.

While plugging away at my own ready-player's pet peeves, I also collected a handful of feature requests. Let's go over the latest features.

## Seek (f/b binding) - [feature request](https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player/issues/11)

While not a feature I initially thought ranked highly in priority, I now find myself seeking audio files from time to time. Ready Player delegates all playback to the likes of [mpv](https://mpv.io/), [vlc](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/), [mplayer](https://mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html), and so on… Up until now, interacting with these utilities merely consisted of feeding a media file path on to the respective process.

Command line utilities like `mpv` offer socket communication via `--input-ipc-server` to enable further requests like seeking forward and back. Ready player now supports seeking via mpv. Maybe support for other utilities can be added in the future.

If you're on a recent version of ready-player, seeking is automatically enabled if you've got mpv installed and aren't explicitly customizing `ready-player-open-playback-commands`. The default value takes care of things:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defcustom ready-player-open-playback-commands
  '(("mpv" "--audio-display=no" "--input-ipc-server=<<socket>>")
    ("vlc")
    ("ffplay")
    ("mplayer"))
  "..."
  :type '(repeat (list string))
  :group 'ready-player)
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/seek-and-you-shall-find/seek.webp)

## Pause/resume (SPC binding) - [feature request](https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player/issues/10)

Until now, ready-player could only play and stop, so you always had to start playing tracks from the beginning. With `mpv` ipc support now in place, adding pause/resume was a breeze. Like seek, it should just work for ya if `mpv` is on your system and no explicit customization of `ready-player-open-playback-commands`.

## Repeat current file (r binding) - [feature request](https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player/issues/16)

While repeating current playlist (or directory) was already supported, there was a feature request to enable repeating files. Toggling repeat now cycles through available modes.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/seek-and-you-shall-find/repeat.webp)

## Selective players - [feature request](https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player/issues/13)

With ready-player delegating to a single utility for either audio or video playback, folks may have a need to specify different utilities for either of these two. While I'm happy for `mpv` to handle both audio and video, we now have a couple of prepending options.

### Use a predicate function

Prepend each utility with either the built-in `ready-player-is-audio-p` or `ready-player-is-video-p` functions, or maybe create your own predicate helper.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(setq ready-player-open-playback-commands
      '((ready-player-is-audio-p "ffplay")
        (ready-player-is-video-p "mpv")))
```

### Use an extension list

In this example, we delegate mp3 and ogg playback to ffplay and everything else to mpv.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(setq ready-player-open-playback-commands
      '((("mp3" "ogg") "ffplay")
        ("mpv")))
```

## Autoplay (a binding) - [feature request](https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player/issues/9)

Automatically start playing once file opens. No need for user to explicitly request playback.

## Mark in dired (m binding) - [feature request](https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player/issues/8)

Open a dired buffer and mark the currently played file.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/seek-and-you-shall-find/mark.gif)

## M3u playlists - [feature request](https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player/issues/14)

While I talked about how [the dired abstraction](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/the-dired-abstraction) made basic m3u playlist support possible, it wasn't until recently that I included this experiment in the package itself. In addition, .m3u are now recognized by Emacs and automatically open like any other file: find-file, dired, projectile…

## Load recursive directory

With [the dired abstraction](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/the-dired-abstraction) at its core, ready player can load any dired buffer. You could do something like:

1.  `M-x find-dired RET`.
2.  Pick a directory. RET.
3.  Type `"-iname \*.mp3 -o -iname \*.ogg -o -iname \*.m4a"` RET.
4.  `M-x ready-player-load-dired-buffer` RET.

While uber flexible, there's no need to regularly do that, so you can now invoke `M-x ready-player-load-directory` and it will recursively find all media files in it.

## Toggle player view (C-c m m binding)

While we can always get back to the player buffer via our favourite buffer-switching mechanism (I like [ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper)'s ivy-switch-buffer), we now have `M-x ready-player-view-player` available for quicker toggle.

## Remember session

Playback is now remembered across Emacs sessions. Toggling player view (C-c m m binding) or playback (C-c m SPC binding) starts the last song you were playing on your previous Emacs session.

## Index + searching (/ or C-c m /)

We now have automatic indexing, which enables richer searching across your collection, not to mention that random access I was craving.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/seek-and-you-shall-find/search.webp)

## Global bindings

Last but not least, you may have noticed a handful of key bindings throughout the post. Single-character bindings all work within a ready-player buffer. Bindings prefixed `C-c m` are now globally available when `ready-player-mode` is turned on. This can be customized via `ready-player-set-global-bindings`.

## Please help make it all self-sustainable

If you find this package useful or got the features you wanted, please [consider sponsoring the work](https://github.com/sponsors/xenodium). I've left my tech job (maybe a post for another time) and looking to make projects like ready-player self-sustainable.

# \[2024-08-23 Fri\] `*scratch*` v1.3 released
---
id: scratch-v1-3-released

It's been some time since the last release of `*scratch*` for iOS. If you haven't heard about `*scratch*`, it's a tiny app I built (part of [the org bundle](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/the-org-bundle)).

`*scratch*` enables writing things on the go *as quickly as possible*.

-   No need to create a new note.
-   No need to bring keyboard up.
-   **Just open and write**.
-   Bonus: Basic Emacs org markup ;-)

v1.3 (and yesterday's v1.2) are now available on the App Store. They are minor releases bringing:

-   A monospaced font.
-   A layout fix for "Settings \> Display & Brightness \> Display Zoom \> Larger Text (often affecting iPhones with smaller screens).
-   A menu fix.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/scratch-v1-3-released/scratch.webp)

Are you a fan of this app? Want to [rate on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1671420139?action=write-review)? Please help me spread the word. Tell your friends.

# \[2024-08-16 Fri\] The dired abstraction
---
id: the-dired-abstraction
---

I recently [wrote about image-mode's next/previous item navigation](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/ready-player-mode), a feature I wanted to bring to [ready player mode](https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player).

I was curious to see how `image-mode` resolved next and previous files, so I checked the associated keybinding (n) via [helpful-key](https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful) (my preferred alternative to [describe-key](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Key-Help.html)), and landed on `image-next-file`. While this function only takes care of high-level routing, it led me to `image-mode--next-file`, which is where the actual next/previous file resolution happens:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun image-mode--next-file (file n)
  "Go to the next image file in the parent buffer of FILE.
This is typically a Dired buffer, but may also be a tar/archive buffer.
Return the next image file from that buffer.
If N is negative, go to the previous file."
  ...)
```

While `image-mode--next-file`'s implementation details are worth [checking out](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/e4d22abcab60ead179e7d114faa4c2def559cfbb/lisp/image-mode.el#L1264), its docstring already highlights the bit I found most interesting: [dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html)'s involvement in the mix. I'm not sure why I initially found `dired` usage surprising. Buffers are Emacs's backbone. They are the fundamental structures holding the content we work with, whether it’s editing text, reading logs, displaying information, and many others including file management… Dired specializes buffers for this last purpose. While `dired` itself is a powerhouse, at its core it's just an ordered list of files.

Given a location within a `dired` buffer, we can use its helpers to find next and previous files. Like `image-mode`, `ready-player` now mirrors this approach (minus tar/archive handling). This got me thinking more about the `dired` abstraction… If it quacks like a duck, and walks like a duck, then it's probably *errrm* a `dired` buffer. What I actually mean is that associating a `dired` buffer to a `ready-player` buffer effectively attaches a playlist of sorts. It doesn't quite matter how this `dired` buffer was constructed. What's important is that it's recognized as a `dired` buffer, so all relevant helpers remain useful.

With `dired` buffers acting as media playlists, we can easily create a directory playlist by merely pointing `dired` to the current directory. This is the default behaviour in `ready-player`. When you open a media file, we attach a `dired` buffer pointing to the current directory. Play next or previous item, and you're effectively moving up and down the associated `dired` buffer.

Things get more interesting when we craft `dired` buffers in more creative ways than just supplying a path to a directory. One of my favourite commands is [find-dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired-and-Find.html). It runs the [find](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html) utility, crafting a `dired` buffer with its results.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/the-dired-abstraction/find.png)

For kicks, I added a `ready-player-load-dired-playback-buffer` command to `ready-player`, so we can just load any `dired` buffer, including our newly generated one, courtesy of `find-dired`.

With this generated buffer loaded and `ready-player` random playback enabled, we get to see our lucky jumps across find results.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/the-dired-abstraction/find-random.gif)

At this point I thought "this is prolly as far as I'll take things"… `ready-player` was born to address quick access to media, typically from `dired` itself. For deep playlist handling, there are many other Emacs media players.

The thing is, with my newly found reusable `dired` abstraction, a rough [m3u](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U) playlist experiment didn't seem that far-fetched at all. I'd need to read an `m3u` file and generate a `dired` buffer. I knew nothing about m3u's, other than being text files including media paths, along with optional metadata. I figured *minimal* m3u reading support shouldn't be too difficult.

If we are to create a playlist including the first three album tracks from the artist above, it'd look something like this:

    #EXTM3U

    #EXTINF:-1,George Benson - Dance
    /absolute/path/to/Music/George Benson/Body Talk/01 Dance.mp3
    #EXTINF:-1,George Benson - When Love Has Grown
    /absolute/path/to/Music/George Benson/Body Talk/02 When Love Has Grown.mp3
    #EXTINF:-1,George Benson - Plum
    /absolute/path/to/Music/George Benson/Body Talk/03 Plum.mp3

    #EXTINF:-1,George Benson - So What
    /absolute/path/to/Music/George Benson/Original Album Classics/1-01 So What.mp3
    #EXTINF:-1,George Benson - The Gentle Rain
    /absolute/path/to/Music/George Benson/Original Album Classics/1-02 The Gentle Rain (From the Film, _The Gentle Rain_).mp3
    #EXTINF:-1,George Benson - All Clear
    /absolute/path/to/Music/George Benson/Original Album Classics/1-03 All Clear.mp3

    #EXTINF:-1,George Benson - Footin' It
    /absolute/path/to/Music/George Benson/The Shape Of Things To Come/01 Footin' It.mp3
    #EXTINF:-1,George Benson - Face It Boy It's Over
    /absolute/path/to/Music/George Benson/The Shape Of Things To Come/02 Face It Boy It's Over.mp3
    #EXTINF:-1,George Benson - Shape Of Things To Come
    /absolute/path/to/Music/George Benson/The Shape Of Things To Come/03 Shape Of Things To Come.mp3

A crude function to extract file paths into a list would look something like the following:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(defun ready-player--media-at-m3u-file (m3u-path)
  "Read m3u playlist at M3U-PATH and return files."
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents m3u-path)
    (let ((files))
      (while (re-search-forward
              (rx bol (not (any "#" space))
                  (zero-or-more (not (any "\n")))
                  eol) nil t)
        (when (file-exists-p (match-string 0))
          (push (match-string 0) files)))
      (nreverse files))))
```

Feeding our m3u file to our new function conveniently returns a list of found files:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
("/absolute/path/to/Music/George Benson/Body Talk/01 Dance.mp3"
 "/absolute/path/to/Music/George Benson/Body Talk/02 When Love Has Grown.mp3"
 "/absolute/path/to/Music/George Benson/Body Talk/03 Plum.mp3"
 "/absolute/path/to/Music/George Benson/Original Album Classics/1-01 So What.mp3"
 "/absolute/path/to/Music/George Benson/Original Album Classics/1-02 The Gentle Rain (From the Film, _The Gentle Rain_).mp3"
 "/absolute/path/to/Music/George Benson/Original Album Classics/1-03 All Clear.mp3"
 "/absolute/path/to/Music/George Benson/The Shape Of Things To Come/01 Footin' It.mp3"
 "/absolute/path/to/Music/George Benson/The Shape Of Things To Come/02 Face It Boy It's Over.mp3"
 "/absolute/path/to/Music/George Benson/The Shape Of Things To Come/03 Shape Of Things To Come.mp3")
```

Next we need to create a dired buffer from a list of files. This is where I thought things would get trickier, but I was pleasantly surprised.

The `dired` docstring had the answer:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dired (dirname &optional switches)
  "...

If DIRNAME is a cons, its first element is taken as the directory name
and the rest as an explicit list of files to make directory entries for.
In this case, SWITCHES are applied to each of the files separately, and
therefore switches that control the order of the files in the produced
listing have no effect.

..."
  ...)
```

With that in mind, this is all it takes:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(let ((default-directory "/absolute/path/to/Music/George Benson"))
  (dired '("*My fancy m3u list*"
           "Body Talk/01 Dance.mp3"
           "Body Talk/02 When Love Has Grown.mp3"
           "Body Talk/03 Plum.mp3"
           "Original Album Classics/1-01 So What.mp3"
           "Original Album Classics/1-02 The Gentle Rain (From the Film, _The Gentle Rain_).mp3"
           "Original Album Classics/1-03 All Clear.mp3"
           "The Shape Of Things To Come/01 Footin' It.mp3"
           "The Shape Of Things To Come/02 Face It Boy It's Over.mp3"
           "The Shape Of Things To Come/03 Shape Of Things To Come.mp3")))
```

Here's the `dired` buffer to prove it:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/the-dired-abstraction/playlist.png)

We now have all the pieces. We can wire them up in a `ready-player-load-m3u-playlist` function.

From the previous snippet, you'd notice all file paths are relative to default-directory. While in the following snippet I use `try-completion` to find the longest common substring amongst the paths, I wonder if there's a more appropriate built-in function for this? [I'd love to hear](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium).

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(defun ready-player-load-m3u-playlist ()
  "Load an .m3u playlist."
  (interactive)
  (let* ((m3u-path (read-file-name "find m3u: " nil nil t nil
                                   (lambda (name)
                                     (or (string-match "\\.m3u\\'" name)
                                         (file-directory-p name)))))
         (media-files (if (string-match "\\.m3u\\'" m3u-path)
                          (ready-player--media-at-m3u-file m3u-path)
                        (error "Not a .m3u file")))
         (default-directory (file-name-directory
                             (try-completion "" media-files)))
         (m3u-fname (file-name-nondirectory m3u-path))
         (dired-buffer-name (format "*%s*" m3u-fname))
         (dired-buffer (dired (append (list dired-buffer-name)
                                      (mapcar (lambda (path)
                                                (file-relative-name path default-directory))
                                              media-files)))))
    (ready-player-load-dired-playback-buffer dired-buffer)))
```

We're good to go now! Invoking `M-x ready-player-load-m3u-playlist` enables us to load our `m3u` playlist, automatically opening the first media file, and also navigate each song in the list one by one.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/the-dired-abstraction/benson.gif)

This was a really fun experiment. While `dired` is often used to manage files within a directory, its magic also extends to `dired` buffers crafted in more creative ways. `find-dired` and `find-grep-dired` are my two favourite built-ins. Are there other ones you like? [Do tell](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium).

Not long ago, I added `ready-player-load-dired-playback-buffer` to ready-player, but `ready-player-load-m3u-playlist` remains a local experiment (for now anyway). Let's see ;-)

# \[2024-08-01 Thu\] Ctrl-n/p everywhere. Balance restored.
---
id: ctrl-np-everywhere-balance-restored
---

For some years now, I've enjoyed [macOS Ctrl-n/p movement everywhere](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/improved-ctrl-p-ctrl-n-macos-movement). I sometimes forget I need [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) to reach certain macOS corners.

macOS supports many Emacs bindings (out of the box). Ctrl-n and Ctrl-p are some of my favourites. Not only can I use these to move the cursor up and down while editing text, but in many cases, for list selections too. Out of the box, list selection, in particular, is more miss than hit. [Spotlight](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp1008/mac) and web drop boxes are the biggest pet peeves. Without remapping, vertical movement can only be achieved via arrow keys.

I had a sudden reminder recently when Spotlight's Ctrl-p/n didn't just work. I wanted to launch Firefox Developer Edition, the second result. Ctrl-n did nothing! The horror!

Turns out, I had a tiny misconfiguration, possibly as I recently switched to using my keyboard via Bluetooth? I needed "Modify events" set for my keyboard.

After setting "Modify events" for my external keyboard, my beloved key bindings started working again. Balance restored.

# \[2024-07-25 Thu\] Emacs macOS native emoji picker (revisited)
---
id: emacs-macos-native-emoji-picker-revisited
---

## Update: Doh! I was wrong. There's a better way.

So, I totally missed the macOS native emoji picker is actually supported out of the box 😭. Thanks to redditor [u/hrabannixlisp](https://www.reddit.com/user/hrabannixlisp/) who [pointed me in the right direction](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1ec5t4j/comment/ley1j59).

`ns-do-show-character-palette` is bound to `C-s-SPC` by default, which didn't work for me as I use `(setq mac-command-modifier 'meta)`, that is, ⌘ as meta modifier.

While I won't be giving up `(setq mac-command-modifier 'meta)`, I can certainly use `ns-do-show-character-palette` via `M-x` or a different binding. Thank you `u/hrabannixlisp`!

## Read on for how I went about it the long convoluted way 🤷‍♂️

A couple of years ago, I was delighted to discover [a macOS freebie for us Emacs users](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/emacs-freebie-macos-emoji-picker). Newer Macbook models started shipping with a globe/🌐 key, which summons the macOS native emoji picker. Pressing this key in Emacs works as you'd expect (no config required 🎉).

While I seldom use emojis, the globe key worked great for me until I started using an external keyboard, which didn't have this magical key. The potential solutions I came across suggest either reprogramming the keyboard or using the likes of [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) to map other keys to an alternate shortcut: `Ctrl-⌘-SPC`. As far as I can tell, this is the only other available shortcut (please reach out if otherwise). Not a great option (it conflicts with Emacs's `mark-sexp`). Not that I'd be super keen to lose this mark command, but even unbinding doesn't seem of much help.

While we have Emacs packages available for different emoji-picking experiences, I was keen on maintaining that native experience I enjoyed before. I nearly gave up on the matter until I remembered we have at least one more tool in the Emacs toolbox: [dynamic modules](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Dynamic-Modules.html). Thanks to Valeriy Savchenko's [emacs-swift-module](https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy/emacs-swift-module), we can leverage Swift to integrate native macOS experiences.

With that in mind, I set out to find the relevant macOS API, which turned out to be a lovely one-liner:

``` swift
NSApp.orderFrontCharacterPalette(nil)
```

Let's bring it into Emacs via `emacs-swift-module`'s infrastructure:

``` swift
try env.defun(
  "macos-module--show-emoji-picker",
  with: "Show emoji picker (macOS module implementation)."
) { (env: Environment) in
  NSApp.orderFrontCharacterPalette(nil)
}
```

In theory, this is all we need. We can `M-x eval-expression` `(macos-module--show-emoji-picker)` and the picker simply pops up. I haven't worked out how define an interactive command from `emacs-swift-module` just yet, so for now I'll just wrap with a little elisp:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun macos-show-emoji-picker ()
  "Show macOS emoji picker."
  (interactive)
  (macos-module--show-emoji-picker))
```

And with that, we got our native macoOS emoji picker back at our fingertips:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-macos-native-emoji-picker-revisited/hearts3.webp)

While the dedicated globe key *just worked* without configuration, it required newer hardware. This new approach works on older Macbooks too. Since it's an interactive command, you can optionally bind to your preferred keys.

Having said all that, you may have noticed a brief lag during insertion. I haven't worked out the source, but since I rarely use emojis, this will have to do for now. If you have a better macOS alternative working on external keyboards, [I'd love to hear about it](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium)!

I've added `macos-show-emoji-picker` to `EmacsMacOSModule`, a tiny repo I've used to experiment with [emacs-swift-module](https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy/emacs-swift-module). You can find `EmacsMacOSModule` on [GitHub](https://github.com/xenodium/EmacsMacOSModule).

# \[2024-07-21 Sun\] Ready Player Mode now on MELPA
---
id: ready-player-mode-now-on-melpa
---

A few weeks ago, I [announced Ready Player Mode](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/ready-player-mode)'s availability on [GitHub](https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player). As of today, you can [find it on MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/ready-player).

Ready Player Mode is a lightweight major mode to open media (audio/video) files in an Emacs buffer.

Install, enable via `M-x ready-player-mode` and you should be good to go.

Open and preview media files (audio + video) like other files. If in repeat mode, ready-player attempts to play other files in the current directory. Track playback from the corresponding `dired` buffer.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/ready-player-mode-now-on-melpa/ready-player.gif)

Playback is handled by your favourite command line utility. `ready-player-mode` will try to use either [mpv](https://mpv.io/), [vlc](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/), [ffplay](https://ffmpeg.org/ffplay.html), or [mplayer](https://mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html) (in that order), but you can customize that. I'd love to hear of other defaults worth considering.

Bonus rendering includes media thumbnails and metadata, if either [ffmpegthumbnailer](https://github.com/dirkvdb/ffmpegthumbnailer) or [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) are found.

# \[2024-07-17 Wed\] OCR those buffers
---
id: ocr-those-buffers
---

I've written about [macosrec](https://github.com/xenodium/macosrec) before. A tiny macOS command line utility I built to [take screenshots or videos of my macOS windows](https://lmno.lol/alvaro/recordscreenshot-windows-the-lazy-way). Sure, there are a gazillion utilities out there, but I wanted my own, so I could bend and integrate with Emacs buffers as needed.

If you've seen me post a screenshot or gif after April 2023, it was likely taken with `macosrec`.

As of `macosrec` v0.7.3, [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) was added to the mix. I've also added a couple of [dwim-shell-commands](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) (`dwim-shell-commands-macos-ocr-text-from-desktop-region` and `dwim-shell-commands-macos-ocr-text-from-image`), so I can do things like:

## OCR region

Use the mouse to select a region to OCR.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/ocr-those-buffers/ocr-region.gif)

\*This gif area recording was captured via macOS's built-in `screencapture`.

## OCR dired files

Selecting any file (or files) in dired OCRs the whole lot.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/ocr-those-buffers/ocr-files.gif)

\*This gif window recording was captured via [macosrec](https://github.com/xenodium/macosrec).

Invoking `dwim-shell-commands-macos-ocr-text-from-image` from the current image buffer does the job also.

## What about non-macOS users?

The same approach can be used with any other OCR command line tool. `dwim-shell-command` includes `dwim-shell-commands-tesseract-ocr-text-from-image`, which uses [tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdoc).

While I've had more reliable results via `macosrec` (using macOS's Vision API), I'm sure there are other great alternatives on linux. If you know of one, [I'd love to hear](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium).

## Available on github

Both [macosrec](https://github.com/xenodium/macosrec) and [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) are on GitHub and installable via `brew install xenodium/macosrec/macosrec` and [MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/dwim-shell-command) respectively.

# \[2024-07-14 Sun\] It's all up for grabs, compound with glue
---
id: its-all-up-for-grabs-and-it-compounds
---

I've written before, once you learn a little [elisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp), [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) becomes this hyper malleable editor/platform. A live playground of sorts, where almost everything is up for grabs. You can inspect and tweak behaviour of just about anything to your liking.

While the compounding benefits of using your favourite Emacs utilities are evident over time, learning elisp takes the compounding effect to another level. It empowers you to have those aha moments like "if I could just wire this awesome utility with that other one, it'd be perfect for me" and enable you to act on it.

Take, for example, [symbol-overlay](https://github.com/wolray/symbol-overlay) and [multiple-cursors](https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el). Two Emacs packages I've been using for years. The first one is a feature you've likely experienced on your favourite IDE or editor without thinking too much about it. Placing your editor cursor on a variable automatically highlights its usages. It's one of those lovely features with zero learning demands.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/its-all-up-for-grabs-and-it-compounds/overlay-symbol.gif)

The second utility, [multiple-cursors](https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el), does demand some learning but can be so fun to use once you get the hang of it. Below is a little multiple cursor demo I used recently [in a reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1dyn3zy/comment/lcbi10o/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), but you really should check out [Emacs Rocks! Episode 13: multiple-cursors](https://emacsrocks.com/e13.html) (stick around for the ending).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/its-all-up-for-grabs-and-it-compounds/mc_x2.gif)

So where am I going with this? While [symbol-overlay](https://github.com/wolray/symbol-overlay) offers a mechanism to rename symbols via `symbol-overlay-rename`, I prefer [multiple-cursors](https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el) for this kind of thing… "if I could just get `symbol-overlay` to tell `multiple-cursors` where to place my cursors, it'd be just perfect for me".

I've been wanting this tweak for some time. Today's the day I finally act on it. I had no idea how to go about it, but opening `symbol-overlay.el` (via `M-x find-library symbol-overlay`) and browsing through all functions (via imenu) yields the first piece I needed: `symbol-overlay-get-list`.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/its-all-up-for-grabs-and-it-compounds/imenu.png)

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun symbol-overlay-get-list (dir &optional symbol exclude)
  "Get all highlighted overlays in the buffer.
If SYMBOL is non-nil, get the overlays that belong to it.
DIR is an integer.
If EXCLUDE is non-nil, get all overlays excluding those belong to SYMBOL."
  ...)
```

Let's take `symbol-overlay-get-list` for a spin, courtesy of `M-x eval-expression`, and see what we get out of it:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/its-all-up-for-grabs-and-it-compounds/eval.gif)

With a list of overlays, we now know where to tell `multiple-cursors` to do its thing. For the second piece, we needed to peek at any of the `multiple-cursors` commands I already use. I happen to pick `mc/mark-all-like-this` to examine what's under the hood.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun mc/mark-all-like-this ()
  "Find and mark all the parts of the buffer matching the currently active region"
  (interactive)
  (unless (region-active-p)
    (error "Mark a region to match first."))
  (mc/remove-fake-cursors)
  (let ((master (point))
        (case-fold-search nil)
        (point-first (< (point) (mark)))
        (re (regexp-opt (mc/region-strings) mc/enclose-search-term)))
    (mc/save-excursion
     (goto-char 0)
     (while (search-forward-regexp re nil t)
       (push-mark (match-beginning 0))
       (when point-first (exchange-point-and-mark))
       (unless (= master (point))
         (mc/create-fake-cursor-at-point))
       (when point-first (exchange-point-and-mark)))))
  (if (> (mc/num-cursors) 1)
      (multiple-cursors-mode 1)
    (mc/disable-multiple-cursors-mode)))
```

The star of the `mc/mark-all-like-this` attraction is `mc/create-fake-cursor-at-point`, used to create each cursor. If we can just iterate over the overlays, we'd be able to create a fake cursor per overlay. There's some additional logic needed to ensure all fake cursors are placed in the same relative position within symbol (using an offset). Finally, we need to enable `multiple-cursors-mode`.

We put it all together in `ar/mc-mark-all-symbol-overlays`:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun ar/mc-mark-all-symbol-overlays ()
  "Mark all symbol overlays using multiple cursors."
  (interactive)
  (mc/remove-fake-cursors)
  (when-let* ((overlays (symbol-overlay-get-list 0))
              (point (point))
              (point-overlay (seq-find
                              (lambda (overlay)
                                (and (<= (overlay-start overlay) point)
                                     (<= point (overlay-end overlay))))
                              overlays))
              (offset (- point (overlay-start point-overlay))))
    (setq deactivate-mark t)
    (mapc (lambda (overlay)
            (unless (eq overlay point-overlay)
              (mc/save-excursion
               (goto-char (+ (overlay-start overlay) offset))
               (mc/create-fake-cursor-at-point))))
          overlays)
    (mc/maybe-multiple-cursors-mode)))
```

and with that, you finally get to see it all in action…

# \[2024-07-03 Wed\] Ready Player Mode
---
id: ready-player-mode
---

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/ready-player-mode/meme.gif)

As an Emacs user, I eventually made the leap over to [dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html) as my file manager of choice. Dired has [magical things like wdired](emacs-git-rename-courtesy-of-dired/). But this post isn't so much about dired and more about the occasional need to peek at media files (images, audio, and video) from Emacs (including dired).

To view images in Emacs, there's [image mode](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Image-Mode.html), a fantastic major mode for taking a quick look without leaving your editor. Image mode strikes a great balance. You can get in quickly and out. The `q` keyboard binding is fabulous for bailing out. While viewing an image, you may quickly open the previous/next one by using `n` and `p` keyboard binding. For me, this is just about all I need within my text editor. For anything else, I resort to my favorite image viewing app (macOS's Preview).

For audio and video, we aren't as lucky with Emacs built-in features (even for a quick peek). While Emacs faithfully opens the files, it's not realistically practical for my typical needs.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/ready-player-mode/no-handling.png)

There's a convenient package aptly named [openwith](https://github.com/jpkotta/openwith), which automatically opens specific files in an external app. This isn't just for media files, but anything really. It works well with office docs, for example. While I've used it for quite some time, I found always bouncing to an external app for peeking at audio/video somewhat suboptimal.

While a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1dtnjy7/is_there_imageview_but_for_audio) yielded some handy options, none were in the same spirit as image mode. Having said that, I did come across [mediainfo-mode](https://github.com/xFA25E/mediainfo-mode) on my search, which is pretty neat for viewing media metadata quickly. Bonus points for `q` keyboard binding to exit and `mediainfo-mode-open` command to open with an external app. There may be other packages out there (I'd love to hear about them), though most seemed to focus on listening to music (and playlist management), which is a different flow from what I'm after.

## Ready player mode enters the chat

With all that, I had no choice (I kid of course) but to go and throw some lines of elisp together and see if I could get to my ideal media experience, and so [ready player mode](https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player) was born…

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/ready-player-mode/ready-player.png)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/ready-player-mode/video-player.png)

As core features, `ready-player-mode` has two buttons: one to play from within Emacs and one to open media in the preferred external app. You can `TAB` your way to the buttons. `RET` or `click` actions the buttons, in addition to the `SPC` keyboard binding to toggle playback.

Like image mode, `ready-player-mode` offers `n/p` navigation to open the next/previous media file in the current directory.

`ready-player-mode` attempts to display basic metadata if possible, courtesy of `ffprobe` and `ffmpeg`. You'll need these installed on your system if you want the optional metadata.

Playback is handled by your favourite command line utility. `ready-player-mode` will try to use either [mpv](https://mpv.io/), [vlc](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/), [ffplay](https://ffmpeg.org/ffplay.html), or [mplayer](https://mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html) (in that order), but you can customize that.

`ready-player-mode` is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/xenodium/ready-player) if you're keen to check it out. Keep in mind this is a brand new package (a day old!), so it may need some improvements. If you do give it a try, [I'd love to hear](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium) how you got on. I've only tested on macOS so far.

# \[2024-06-07 Fri\] Hey mouse, don't mess with my Emacs font size
---
id: hey-mouse-dont-mess-with-my-emacs-font-size
---

While most of my Emacs workflows are typically keyboard-driven, I'm fairly pragmatic about mouse usage. My MacBook's trackpad is great for just kicking back to read and scroll through text.

There are brief times, however, when that keyboard-driven muscle memory overlaps my mouse usage, resulting in a buffer catastrophe. I joke of course. What I'm actually referring to is nothing more than a slight annoyance. There are times when I inadvertently trigger `<C-wheel-up>` or `<C-wheel-down>` events (because I happen to hold `Ctrl` down while triggering scrolling events). This results in buffer font size quickly changing to either really large or super small, depending on whether I was scrolling up or down at the time. The snafu is further exacerbated by inertial scrolling on trackpads. Go ahead and press the Ctrl key while your buffer is carrying some of that inertia. The font size is affected just the same, even though there was no explicit physical/touching activity on the trackpad at the time.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/hey-mouse-dont-mess-with-my-emacs-font-size/scroll-reduces-font-size.gif)

While this behaviour was a little annoying, I would typically just reopen the file via `C-x C-v RET` (aka `find-alternate-file`), which would reset the font size as a convenient side-effect. Now, you may wonder if reopening the file would also forget the point/cursor position, but that's not an issue if you've got the handy built-in [save-place-mode](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SavePlace) turned on (highly recommended).

Ok and all, but this is a second-class workaround at best. What I really wanted is for the mouse/trackpad to stop messing with my font size.

Lucky for me, I bumped into a [simple solution](https://indieweb.social/@goldayan@clj.social/112195984778424216) shared by [Shane Celis](https://indieweb.social/@shanecelis@mastodon.gamedev.place) and [Thanga Ayyanar](https://indieweb.social/@goldayan@clj.social). It worked a treat, and it's only a few lines of elisp.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(global-set-key (kbd "<pinch>") 'ignore)
(global-set-key (kbd "<C-wheel-up>") 'ignore)
(global-set-key (kbd "<C-wheel-down>") 'ignore)
```

Thank you folks. Balance restored.

## Update

While I was using `C-x C-v RET` (aka `find-alternate-file`) to reset font size, [Luke T. Shumaker](https://fosstodon.org/@lukeshu/112577135094007001) and [Matthew G.](https://social.lol/@starbreaker/112577354623711993) shared a better reset alternative:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}

# \[2024-05-16 Thu\] Emacs: git rename, courtesy of dired
---
id: emacs-git-rename-courtesy-of-dired
---

Emacs [wdired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Wdired.html) is a beautiful thing. You turn a directory representation into an editable buffer and you can do some magic. By magic, I mean you can apply your favourite text-editing commands to a directory and do some file management.

Take, for example, batch-renaming. Turn `wdired` on via `dired-toggle-read-only`, use something like Magnar's [multiple-cursors](https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el) (or built-in [keyboard macros](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Keyboard-Macros.html)) and commit via `wdired-finish-edit` (using the often-familar `C-c C-c` binding). You've now renamed multiple files as it if were any other text buffer. Pretty magical.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-git-rename-courtesy-of-dired/wdired.gif)

One downside (or so I thought) is that wdired didn't automagically also take care of git renames for me, you know [DWIM-style](emacs-dwim-do-what-i-mean/).

Every time I renamed anything via `wdired` and subsequently pulled up my trusty [magit](https://magit.vc/), I was a little sad it wasn't all just handled… The renamed files were seen as deleted, along with all the untracked counterparts.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-git-rename-courtesy-of-dired/rename-no-git.png)

So, I set out to change this unacceptable state of affairs 😀. I started off by setting a breakpoint on `wdired-finish-edit` via edebug (see [why this util is awesome](inline-previous-result-and-why-you-should-edebug/)).

I wanted to see what `wdired-finish-edit` did under the hood, which led me to `dired-rename-file`. As I stepped through the code, I spotted the `dired-vc-rename-file` variable, which does exactly what you think it does 🤦.

One `setq` later…

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(setq dired-vc-rename-file t)
```

…and boom! From now on, renaming from dired does exactly what you would expect. Here's `magit` to prove it:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-git-rename-courtesy-of-dired/rename-with-git.png)

lol. I was so fixated on "adding git rename support", that I forgot to first search the documentation.

While you can search for variables via the built-in `describe-variable`, I'm a fan of Wilfred's [helpful](https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful) equivalent: `helpful-variable`. Coupled with with your favourite completion framework (Abo Abo's [ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) for me), it's as easy a fuzzy searching for anything you're after:

# \[2024-04-03 Wed\] Fresh Eyes: 20-20-20 for macOS
---
id: fresh-eyes-20-20-20-for-macos
---

I've been lucky to have enjoyed healthy vision throughout my life. That is, until recently. Nothing major, I'll need glasses for some activities. I also learned from the optometrist I should follow the [20-20-20 rule](https://www.sbs.nhs.uk/information/home-working-looking-after-eyes) to reduce eye strain.

The **20-20-20 rule** is simple:

Take a break from looking at your computer screen every **20 minutes** and look away at something roughly **20 feet away** (6 metres) for **20 seconds**.

While there are no shortages of macOS timer apps available, I figured it'd be fun to build a 20-20-20 one anyway.

Meet **Fresh Eyes**. I've been using it in the last few days. If you'd like to give it a try, send me an email at me@xenodium.com and I'll reply with a TestFlight invite.

# \[2024-03-25 Mon\] Emacs 29.3 emergency release
---
id: emacs-293-emergency-release
---

It was only last week when I upgraded to Emacs 29.2. Yup, I was late to the party. This week, we have a new release.

Emacs 29.3 is an [emergency bugfix release](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2024-03/msg00611.html), so this time I've upgraded promptly. I'm on macOS using the great [Emacs Plus](https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus) so upgraded via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) using:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew reinstall emacs-plus@29 --with-imagemagick --with-no-frame-refocus --with-native-comp --with-savchenkovaleriy-big-sur-3d-icon --with-poll
```

# \[2024-03-24 Sun\] Emacs: Toggling the continuation indicator
---
id: toggling-emacs-continuation-fringe-indicator
---

By default, Emacs typically displays curly arrows when wrapping lines. While likely a handy feature to some, I didn't really find much use for it. At the same time, I never looked into their removal until now.

Turns out, there's a `continuation` entry in `fringe-indicator-alist` variable that handles this. Removing this entry also removes the curly arrows.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(setq-default fringe-indicator-alist
              (delq (assq 'continuation fringe-indicator-alist) fringe-indicator-alist))
```

Alternatively, one could write a simple function to toggle displaying the continuation indicator.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/toggling-emacs-continuation-fringe-indicator/curly.gif)

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun toggle-continuation-fringe-indicator ()
  (interactive)
  (setq-default
   fringe-indicator-alist
   (if (assq 'continuation fringe-indicator-alist)
       (delq (assq 'continuation fringe-indicator-alist) fringe-indicator-alist)
     (cons '(continuation right-curly-arrow left-curly-arrow) fringe-indicator-alist))))
```

That's it for this post. A tiny tip. Perhaps there's a better way to handle it. If you know, I'd love to know too ([Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xenodium) / [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/xenodium) / [Email](mailto:me__AT__xenodium.com)).

# \[2024-03-22 Fri\] The Org bundle
---
id: the-org-bundle
---

I have [three apps on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/xenodium-ltd/id304568690): [Plain Org](https://plainorg.com), [Flat Habits](https://flathabits.com/), and [scratch](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scratch/id1671420139).

## Plain Org / [plainorg.com](https://plainorg.com)

My more generic solution to access org files on the go and away from Emacs.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/the-org-bundle/plainorg-600x0w.png)

## Flat Habits / [flathabits.com](https://flathabits.com/)

My take on frictionless habit tracking truly respecting user privacy and their time (absolutely no distractions).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/the-org-bundle/flathabits-600x0w.png)

## `*scratch*` / [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scratch/id1671420139)

Sure, we have tons of note-taking apps but most require more steps than desirable to write something down ASAP. Launch the app and you're good to write. No new note creation, bring keyboard up, etc.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/the-org-bundle/scratch-600x0w.webp)

## Common denominator

In addition to being offline-first, no cloud, no login, no ads, no tracking, no social… each app targets a specific purpose, sharing an important common denominator: they all use [org markup](https://orgmode.org/) as the underlying storage.

## The Org bundle / [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app-bundle/the-org-bundle/id1717663541)

While you can still get each of my apps individually, you now have the option to get them all as a single bundle: [The Org bundle](https://apps.apple.com/us/app-bundle/the-org-bundle/id1717663541).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/the-org-bundle/bundle.png)

## Journelly joining the bundle soon…

Continuing on the org storage theme, I got another app in the works. Also joining [The Org bundle](https://apps.apple.com/us/app-bundle/the-org-bundle/id1717663541), maintaining its privacy-first approach: offline, no cloud, no login, no ads, no tracking, no social… this time in the journaling space.

Emacs 29 [introduced the handy sqlite-mode](emacs-29s-sqlite-mode). Soon after, I tried a couple of experiments [here](further-sqlite-mode-extensions/) and [there](sqlite-mode-goodies) to bring additional functionality.

Folks reached out. The additions seemed useful to them and were keen on upstreaming or pushing to MELPA. While I can't commit to upstreaming at this moment, I can happily meet halfway on MELPA.

As of a couple of days, you can find [sqlite-mode-extras](https://github.com/xenodium/sqlite-mode-extras) on [MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/sqlite-mode-extras) and [GitHub](https://github.com/xenodium/sqlite-mode-extras). Contributions [totally welcome](https://github.com/xenodium/sqlite-mode-extras/pulls?q=is%3Apr).

While I haven't heard of issues, please continue treating the package as experimental and exercise safety with your data. Please back up.

# \[2024-03-19 Tue\] Som tam salad dressing recipe (improvised)
---
id: som-tam-salad-dressing-recipe-improvised
---

Lately, I've been slightly obsessed with [Som Tam](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012589-som-tum-green-papaya-salad), a magnificent salad packing both crunch and flavour.

I didn't have all the right ingredients for the full-blown salad at home, so I set out to experiment with the dressing's punchy flavours. While I've gone a little rogue here, I mean no disrespect to the faithful recipe and all its glory. Luckily, I did have fish sauce at home, which I considered the core ingredient, and made do with everything else I could find.

This is where I landed:

-   2 cloves of garlic
-   Thai chillies to taste (improvised with chilli flakes)
-   2 tablespoons of fish sauce
-   1 tablespoons of palm sugar (improvised with honey)
-   2 limes squeezed (improvised with lemon)
-   1 tablespoon of dried shrimp (didn't have any)
-   1 small plum tomato (I used 2 of those bite-size ones)

Using my trusty mortar and pestle, I ground and crushed the garlic, chilli flakes, and tomato, forming a paste of sorts. Then added the remaining liquids (fish sauce, honey and lemon) diluting the paste.

-   2 tablespoons of roasted peanuts (roasted some cashews)

Most recipes seem to suggest using peanuts, though my local Thai restaurant uses cashews. Luckily I had cashews at home, so I'm copied my local. Roasted them on pan for a few minutes.

As you can imagine, I didn't just have a green papaya laying around at home, so I experimented with other crunchy veggies. While I won't reveal what the other veggies were (oh man, I've gone way off script), both my other half and I were happy with the results.

Som Tam dressing packs an awesome punch. If your salads were feeling a little boring, give this a try!

# \[2024-03-14 Thu\] My first bread (pane dei Castelli recipe)
---
id: my-first-bread-pane-dei-castelli-recipe
---

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/my-first-bread-pane-dei-castelli-recipe/my-bread.jpg)

I followed [The easiest no knead bread recipe](https://www.emmafontanella.com/the-easiest-no-knead-bread) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xtj9X1jDc0)).

## No-knead method

### Dough

-   1 1/4 cups (300g) lukewarm water
-   2 teaspoons (8g) salt
-   1 teaspoon (3.5g) yeast
-   3 cups (420g) all purpose flour

Mix thoroughly (I like to use Ciro's spoon mixing method from [this video](https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20200415-how-to-make-pizza-like-a-neapolitan-master)), cover and rest for 6 hours. Stretch and fold if the dough collapsed on itself to rescue.

### Bake

-   Preheat oven (and dutch oven) at 230°C.
-   Flour.

I didn't have a dutch oven, but my oven-proof saucepans (with lid) did just fine. Carefully take the pan out of the oven, sprinkle the bottom with some flour, and place the dough inside. Cover with lid (careful, also hot) and bake for 30-35 minutes.

### Crust

-   Reduce heat to 200°C.

Remove the lid and bake for another 10 minutes or until you get the crust darkness of your choice.

### Rest

Let the bread cool on a cooling rack for 45 mins before cutting. If no rack available, set upsidedown.

## Stretch and fold method

### Dough

-   1 1/4 cups (300g) lukewarm water
-   2 1/2 teaspoons (10g) salt
-   2 teaspoon (7g) yeast
-   3 cups (420g) all purpose flour

Mix thoroughly (I like to use Ciro's spoon mixing method from [this video](https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20200415-how-to-make-pizza-like-a-neapolitan-master)), cover and rest for 6 hours. Stretch and fold if the dough collapsed on itself to rescue.

### Stretch and fold

See [Emma Fontanella](https://www.emmafontanella.com/the-easiest-no-knead-bread)'s stretch and fold technique and apply 4-5 times every 30 mins.

### Follow no-knead method

Remaining steps are the same as the no-knead method.

---
id: seafood-stew-recipe
---

I've made this seafood stew a handful of times and it's always delivered.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/seafood-stew-recipe/IMG_7030.jpg)

## Garlic almond paste

-   1/8 cup of olive oil.
-   8 cloves of garlic chopped.
-   1/4 cup almond meal (flour).

Cook garlic in low-medium heat until softened. Add almond meal and cook 3-4 mins or until golden. Set aside to cool.

-   1 large handful of parsley.

Blend the almond mixture to make a paste. Set aside.

## Spices

-   1 large onion halved and sliced.

In a large pan, cook onion until softened.

-   1/8 cup of olive oil.
-   1 large red chilli finely chopped (on occasions, I use chilli flakes).
-   1 teaspoon of smoked paprika.
-   2 bay leaves.

Add chilli, paprika, and bay leaves and cook for 30 seconds (or fragrant).

## Liquids

-   1/3 cup dry white wine (I've used cooking sake on occasion).
-   1000g of passata (typically comes in 500g packs).
-   400g plum tomatoes tin (undrained).
-   1 teaspoon of saffron threads (soaked in 2 tablespoons of water).
-   1 tablespoon of tomato paste.
-   2 cups of fish stock (I've used 2 stock cubes + same amount of water).

Add the wine, passata, plum tomatoes, saffron, tomato pate, and fish stock. Simmer for 10 minutes.

## Fish

-   700g of firm white fish (cut into 5 cm chunks).
-   12 mussels.

Add the almond paste, fish, and mussels. Cook for 3-4 minutes.

-   12 prawns (shelled).

Add the prawns. Cook for 3 minutes (or pink).

## Finishing touches

Season with salt and pepper to taste. I've added roughly a teaspoon of salt.

Garnish generously with parsley and you're good to go.

o______________o
| Hello world! |
o--------------o
        \   ^__^

            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||

```

Keen to get started with your *Hello World* Cloudflare Worker? Skip to the [setup](id:cloudflare-worker-hello-world-setup) section.

## A little background

The vast majority of my software development experience has been centered around client-side software. The few times I've needed a server-side component for a hobby project, I've historically provisioned a linux [virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) somewhere and ran whatever services I needed. I have to admit though, I don't enjoy the provisioning process, configuration, maintenance, upgrades, database admin, etc. which take time away from the part I enjoy more: building and experimenting with features.

While [containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerization_(computing)) have made things somewhat simpler, much of the maintenance tradeoffs remain.

These days, the server-managing overhead has been greatly reduced by "[serverless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing)" solutions. Odd terminology for a server offering, but I digress. It more or less refers to removing most of that additional responsibility that comes with managing your own servers and enabling you to focus on building your business logic. Having said that, I've typically shied away from these services, with the possibly irrational fear of vendor lock-in.

The thing is, if most of my potential server-side needs merely require an entry point (where I could route/handle incoming requests) and possibly some persistence (maybe a database), I should be able to abstract these things away and build server-side logic against portable abstractions. With that in place, maybe there's little vendor lock-in to worry about? Who knows, the devil's in the detail. If I keep shying away from these services, I'll never know, so maybe I should try some and see.

## Let's try Cloudflare Workers

There are no shortages of serverless options offering [functions as a service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_as_a_service). Google Cloud, AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Vercel Functions, Netlify Functions, Fastly, Cloudflare workers, I could go on…

While I haven't researched the different offerings, I had made a mental note to check out Cloudflare Workers as they had [announced D1](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-d1), their database backed by SQLite …and who doesn't love SQLite? ;) OK, I'm no expert here, but I have had a pleasant experience whenever I've used it. These days, even [Emacs 29 got some SQLite love](emacs-29s-sqlite-mode/), which prompted me to add [cell navigation/navigation](sqlite-mode-goodies/) and [try other experiments](further-sqlite-mode-extensions/).

## D1 / SQLite in beta

Keep in mind that D1 is in public beta and not yet recommended for large production workloads. From the [Cloudflare site](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/):

> "While the D1 team expects breaking changes and issues to be minimal, they may still occur. The D1 team generally does not recommend running large production workloads on beta products."

## Workers cost

In terms of pricing (as of 2024-01-13), the [free tier](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing) enables workers to handle up 100,000 requests per day. Plenty for trying things out.

In any case, we're only checking out Cloudflare's offering, so let's move on…

## Settings up a new Cloudflare Worker (via web dash) {#settings-up-a-new-cloudflare-worker-via-web-dash id="cloudflare-worker-hello-world-setup"}

Cloudflare has a tiny snippet on their [Workers landing page](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) that sets things up rather quickly, but [I won't be using it]{.underline}.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
~/ $ npm create cloudflare -- my-app
~/ $ cd my-app
~/ $ npx wrangler deploy
Published https://my-app.world.workers.dev
```

⚠️ *Note: before you get copying and pasting, read on.*

Cloudflare's snippet is helpful, but it does quite a bit under the hood. I'm somewhat of a node and serverless noob, so I wanted to understand things a little more and figure out the bare minimum needed to start a minimal Cloudflare Worker project.

Instead, we'll first click here and there over at <https://dash.cloudflare.com> to spin off our new worker from the web and later continue from the command line.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-cloudflare-workers-primer-hello-world/cf-new-0.png)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-cloudflare-workers-primer-hello-world/cf-new-1.png)

Give the worker a name. We'll call it "todos" to give ya a little sneak peek at what the next post is possibly about… But you can call it whatever you'd like. Keep in mind you'll need to use this name to refer to your new worker.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-cloudflare-workers-primer-hello-world/cf-new-2.png)

Congrats, you've now deployed a new worker. You can access it via the URL that looks something like <https://todos.somewhere.workers.dev>

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-cloudflare-workers-primer-hello-world/hello-dark.png)

This is great and all, but we want to build something with this new worker, so let's set up our local development environment…

## Prerequisites

You'll need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

I happen to be on macOS, so I installed node via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install node
```

## Create a new node project

We want to start with a bare bones node project, so let's do just that.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
mkdir HelloCloudflareWorker
cd HelloCloudflareWorker
npm init -y
```

## Install TypeScript (compiler)

I like some guardrails when targetting Javascript, so I'll use the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) compiler in this project. Let's install it.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
npm install --save-dev typescript
npx tsc --init
```

## Install Cloudflare Typescript types

To have Cloudflare types information accessible to the TypeScript compiler, we'll need to install that too.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
npm install --save-dev @cloudflare/workers-types
```

## Install Wrangler (Cloudflare tooling)

To manage your worker from the command-line, you'll need Cloudflare's [wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) tool. Let's install it.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
npm install --save-dev wrangler
```

## Point Wrangler to our worker

We're done installing things now. Let's point wrangler to our new worker by creating its config file.

`wrangler.toml`

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
name = "todos"
main = "worker/worker.ts"
```

## Worker entry point

By default, the worker we created using Cloudflare's dash has the following entry point:

``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    return new Response( 'Hello World!'):
  }
}
```

However, this isn't yet included in our development environment. We need to write our first bit of code. You may have noticed our `wrangler.toml` is pointing to the main entry point (`worker/worker.ts`) and this file doesn't exist yet. Let's create it, though be sure to also create its owning directory:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
mkdir worker
```

Now we can create our very own `worker/worker.ts`. Let's make the first change that shapes worker to our liking. Rather than just printing "Hello World", let's style things up using our [cow friend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay). We'll create `worker/worker.ts` and include the spiffed up message.

`worker/worker.ts`

``` {.javascript org-language="js"}
import { Env, ExecutionContext } from '@cloudflare/workers-types';

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext): Promise<Response> {
    let defaultResponse = `
   o______________o
   | Hello World! |
   o--------------o
           \\   ^__^
            \\  (oo)\_______
               (__)\\       )\\/\\
                   ||----w |
                   ||     ||`
    return new Response(defaultResponse);
  }
};
```

It's worth mentioning the import statement, since it brings Cloudflare's type information for both `Env` and `ExecutionContext`.

## Running worker locally

Okay, we now have our `worker/worker.ts` code ready to go. Let's run it locally. For that we use the wrangler utility.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
npx wrangler dev
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-cloudflare-workers-primer-hello-world/dev.png)

With that, you'll notice the worker is now running locally and waiting to be visited at <http://localhost:8787>.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-cloudflare-workers-primer-hello-world/moo.png)

## Deploying worker

When we first created the worker via <https://dash.cloudflare.com>, it automatically deployed to <https://todos.somewhere.workers.dev>. But our mods only ran locally. Let's deploy, again with the wrangler utility.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
npx wrangler deploy
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-cloudflare-workers-primer-hello-world/deploying.png)

We're good to go. Let's point our browser to the worker's public location.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-cloudflare-workers-primer-hello-world/deployed.png)

…and with that, we have a functional Cloudflare Worker and a local development environment to shape things up however we'd like. What would you use the Worker for?

# \[2024-01-01 Mon\] A chatgpt-shell compose ux experiment
---
id: a-chatgpt-shell-compose-ux-experiment
---

It's been roughly 9 months since I [experimented](a-chatgpt-emacs-shell/) with wiring the [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) API to an Emacs [comint](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shell-Prompts.html) buffer in [chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell). ChatGPT's request-response nature maps fairly well to a shell's mode of interaction.

In the past, I've also talked about [blurring the lines between shell and editor](yasnippet-in-emacs-eshell/). That is, using Emacs as your shell ([eshell](https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/complete-guide-mastering-eshell) being my favourite) enables compounding goodies from both shell and editor when both are used from the same app.

Keeping interactions within the same app also cuts down on some of that friction that comes with context switching between your text editor and the browser for [llm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) things.

Today, my interactions with llms typically consists of copying and pasting details from other Emacs buffers, crafting a query, and finally submitting by pressing enter (RET) from a shell like [chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-chatgpt-shell-compose-ux-experiment/shell-find-bug.gif)

With the entire interaction happening from Emacs, we're already cutting a fair amount of friction… But we can do better, specially when copying, pasting, and crafting those multi-line queries (you don't want to prematurely submit those shell queries by inadvertently pressing RET when you want a newline).

## chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose

This is where `chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose` comes in, an opinionated experiment bringing some of my favourite "compose" features over from the likes of [magit](https://github.com/magit) commit buffers, [org capture](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/org/Using-capture.html), [mu4e](https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e/) compose, and so on…

You can bring a compose buffer up by invoking `M-x chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose`. From there, you can both craft and send your queries. If you're a magit fan, the process should feel fairly familiar with crafting a git commit message by editing away and quickly committing (via `C-c C-c` binding). Similarly, you can also abort with the familiar `C-c C-k` binding.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-chatgpt-shell-compose-ux-experiment/10k.gif)

I use this compose utility often enough that I bound it to `C-c C-e`, though this may not be your cup of tea (needs overriding other mode maps).

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(use-package chatgpt-shell
  :commands
  (chatgpt-shell
   chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose)
  :bind (("C-c C-e" . chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose)
         :map org-mode-map
         ("C-c C-e" . chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose)
         :map eshell-mode-map
         ("C-c C-e" . chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose)
         :map mu4e-compose-mode-map
         ("C-c C-e" . chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose)
         :map emacs-lisp-mode-map
         ("C-c C-e" . chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose)))
```

While the compose buffer displays a single query/response at a time, it also follows on from previous requests. You can press `r` to reply and continue the conversation.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-chatgpt-shell-compose-ux-experiment/marathon.gif)

The compose buffer is fairly stateless and mostly serves as viewport over the last query in the shell itself. If you invoke `chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose` with a prefix (ie. C-u), it wipes the shell history. You can do it from the compose buffer itself, if you forgot to prior to launching.

You can also use the `o` binding to jump to the "other buffer" (the shell carrying the conversation history).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-chatgpt-shell-compose-ux-experiment/other.gif)

If using the `r` and `o` bindings in a compose buffer sounds a little strange, fear not. The compose buffer is writeable while crafting queries, thus you can safely insert any character. Once a query is submitted (via `C-c C-c`), the buffer automatically becomes read-only, and thus unlocking single-character bindings.

Another magit commit favorite of mine is using the `M-p` or `M-n` bindings to insert previous messages via `git-commit-prev-message` or `git-commit-next-message`.

With that in mind, I also brought `M-p` and `M-n` over to the editable compose buffer.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-chatgpt-shell-compose-ux-experiment/previous-next-history.gif)

If cycling isn't efficient enough, you can also use the typical `M-r` binding to search and insert from history.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-chatgpt-shell-compose-ux-experiment/search-history.png)

Now, getting back to removing some of that copy-pasting friction… Selecting text in any buffer and invoking `M-x chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose` (or `C-c C-e` in my case) automatically pastes the region into the compose buffer. You get to tweak your query before submitting (via that familiar `C-c C-c`), in a more flexible buffer (compared to a shell).

*Note: You can also invoke the compose command with a region as many times as you'd like. Each region is sent to the compose buffer, so you can craft more involved queries before submission.*

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-chatgpt-shell-compose-ux-experiment/find-and-fix-bug.gif)

While I typically prefer short query responses (using diffs like the example above), I sometimes want full snippets as follow-ups. I found myself typing *"show entire snippet"* often enough, that I now use one of those single-character bindings (`e`) for this purpose.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-chatgpt-shell-compose-ux-experiment/show-entire-snippet.gif)

## Compose bindings

I've showcased most of the compose key bindings, here's the whole lot (so far anyway), which you can also view from `chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose`'s documentation.

### Editing

-   `C-c C-c` to send the buffer query.
-   `C-c C-k` to cancel compose buffer.
-   `M-r` search through history.
-   `M-p` cycle through previous item in history.
-   `M-n` cycle through next item in history.

### Read-only

-   `C-c C-c` After sending offers to abort query in-progress.
-   `q` Exits the read-only buffer.
-   `g` Refresh (re-send the query). Useful to retry on disconnects.
-   `n` Jump to next source block.
-   `p` Jump to next previous block.
-   `r` Reply to follow-up with additional questions.
-   `e` Send "Show entire snippet" query.
-   `o` Jump to other buffer (ie. the shell itself).
-   `C-M-h` Mark block at point.

## Buyer beware: it's all pretty experimental

When I started playing with the compose buffer idea, I wasn't too sure whether or not its usage would stick, so I basically hacked `chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose` to pieces. A cheap prototype of sorts to validate the idea before fully committing to a more involved solution.

I'll eventually rewrite `chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose` as either a major or minor mode if there's enough interest.

For now, I'll continue using as is to validate its usefulness.

If you give `chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose` a try, I'd love to hear your feedback ([Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xenodium) / [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/xenodium) / [Email](mailto:me__AT__xenodium.com)).

id: are-you-vi-or-emacs

I've enjoyed watching [A Murder at the End of the World](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15227418/). The show may resonate with folks following the tech world. Won't say much more than that…

What I can maybe say is, the shows features [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/), [Brave browser](https://brave.com/), terminal usage (ifconfig, nmap, hydra, responder), and a reference to the good 'ol [Vi vs Emacs rivalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war), which I hope folks these days don't take further than friendly teasing between dear cousins.

In any case, being an Emacs nut, the scene gave me a good tickle. It's a great show, with a lovely Emacs cherry on top! While the show title and description didn't immediately draw me in, I'm glad I gave it a chance.

# \[2023-12-17 Sun\] An basic Mullvad WireGuard setup for macOS

Needed a VPN to test an API from a different location. Gave [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en) a try.

Pretty neat, you can generate an account number without providing an email address. You can also pre-pay with a ton of options, including cash, crypto, credit cards, PayPal, wire transfers…

After seeing your account credited, one can download a [generated WireGuard configuration](https://mullvad.net/en/account/wireguard-config). Also a WireGuard noob, so took this opportunity to give it a try.

The [WireGuard macOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1451685025?mt=12) has an "Import Tunnel(s) from File…" option where you can import the .conf file downloaded from [Mullvad's generated config](https://mullvad.net/en/account/wireguard-config). After that, all I had to do was click the "Activate" button and [Bob's your uncle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%27s_your_uncle).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-quick-mullvad-macos-setup/wg-redact.png)

You can test your connection via:

``` bash
curl https://am.i.mullvad.net/connected
```

I had a brief stint at using the command-line alternative via homebrew `brew install wireguard-go wireguard-tools`, but that seems to fail silently:

# \[2023-12-06 Wed\] An iOS journaling app powered by org plain text
---
id: an-ios-journaling-app-powered-by-org-plain-text
---

I've been experimenting with building a rich text editing component for iOS, powered by [org](https://orgmode.org/) markup. The idea is to offer a mobile-friendly editing experience, backed by our beloved plain text format.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/an-ios-journaling-app-powered-by-org-plain-text/rich-text-experiment.gif)

To make things a little more interesting, I'm introducing a new org-based app to help anyone with regular journaling.

<center>👉 Meet ✨Journelly✨</center>

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/an-ios-journaling-app-powered-by-org-plain-text/journelly.jpg)

Plain text *is* the serialization format. No conversion/import/export needed.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/an-ios-journaling-app-powered-by-org-plain-text/journelly.gif)

Though it's early days, it's fairly functional. Been using it daily for some time. You can opt in to use an external org file and sync with your beloved Emacs.

Want to give it a try? Want a TestFlight invite? Send me an email address (any would do) at either of these: [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xenodium) / [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/xenodium) / [Email](mailto:me__AT__xenodium.com).

The topic of org being fairly Emacs-oriented, though a strength for someone far down the rabbit hole, it is [understandable to call it out for someone in a different position](https://indieweb.social/@ringtailringo@mastodon.social/111533733278287863). Lucky for us, org markup is plain text and can be implemented by apps other than Emacs, like Journelly itself for iOS and even more experimentally on macOS:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/an-ios-journaling-app-powered-by-org-plain-text/macos.png)

And like Journelly for iOS, I got other org things available on iOS:

<table>

# \[2023-11-29 Wed\] Building your own bookmark launcher
---
id: building-your-own-bookmark-launcher
---

*✨[sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/xenodium)✨ this content*

I've been toying with the idea of managing browser bookmarks from [you know where](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). Maybe dump a bunch of links into an org file and use that as a quick and dirty bookmark manager. We'll start with a flat list plus fuzzy searching and see how far that gets us.

The org file would look a little something like this:

::: captioned-content
::: caption
bookmarks.org
:::

``` org
My bookmarks
- [[https://lobste.rs/t/emacs][Emacs editor (Lobsters)]]
- [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com][Emacs Stack Exchange]]
- [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs][Emacs subreddit]]
- [[https://emacs.ch][Emacs.ch (Mastodon)]]
- [[https://www.emacswiki.org][EmacsWiki]]
- [[https://planet.emacslife.com/][Planet Emacslife]]
```
:::

Next we need fuzzy searching, but first let's write a little elisp to extract all links from the org file:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(require 'org-element)
(require 'seq)

(defun browser-bookmarks (org-file)
  "Return all links from ORG-FILE."
  (with-temp-buffer
    (let (links)
      (insert-file-contents org-file)
      (org-mode)
      (org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer) 'link
        (lambda (link)
          (let* ((raw-link (org-element-property :raw-link link))
                 (content (org-element-contents link))
                 (title (substring-no-properties (or (seq-first content) raw-link))))
            (push (concat title
                          "\n"
                          (propertize raw-link 'face 'whitespace-space)
                          "\n")
                  links)))
        nil nil 'link)
      (seq-sort 'string-greaterp links))))
```

The snippet uses `org-element` to iterate over links to collect/return them in a list. We join both the title and url, so searching can match either of these values. We also add a little formatting (new lines/face) to spiff things up.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" results="value code"}
(browser-bookmarks "/private/tmp/bookmarks.org")
```

We can now feed our list to our preferred narrowing framework (ivy, helm, ido, vertico) and use it to quickly select a bookmark. In the past, I've [used the likes of ivy-read](emacs-utilities-for-your-os/) directly, though have since adopted the humble but mighty `completing-read` which hooks up to any of the above frameworks.

With that in mind, let's use `completing-read` to make a selection and split the text to extract the corresponding URL. Feed it to `browse-url`, and you got your preferred browser opening your bookmark.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun open-bookmark ()
  (interactive)
  (browse-url (seq-elt (split-string (completing-read "Open: " (browser-bookmarks "/private/tmp/bookmarks.org")) "\n") 1)))
```

I remain a happy ivy user, so we can see its fuzzy searching in action.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/building-your-own-bookmark-launcher/emacs-bookmark.gif)

At this point, we now have our bookmark-launching Emacs utility. It's only an `M-x open-bookmark` command away, but we want to make it accessible from anywhere in our operating system, in my case macOS.

Let's enable launching from the command line, though before we do that, let's craft a dedicated frame for this purpose.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defmacro present (&rest body)
  "Create a buffer with BUFFER-NAME and eval BODY in a basic frame."
  (declare (indent 1) (debug t))
  `(let* ((buffer (get-buffer-create (generate-new-buffer-name "*present*")))
          (frame (make-frame '((auto-raise . t)
                               (font . "Menlo 15")
                               (top . 200)
                               (height . 20)
                               (width . 110)
                               (internal-border-width . 20)
                               (left . 0.33)
                               (left-fringe . 0)
                               (line-spacing . 3)
                               (menu-bar-lines . 0)
                               (minibuffer . only)
                               (right-fringe . 0)
                               (tool-bar-lines . 0)
                               (undecorated . t)
                               (unsplittable . t)
                               (vertical-scroll-bars . nil)))))
     (set-face-attribute 'ivy-current-match frame
                         :background "#2a2a2a"
                         :foreground 'unspecified)
     (select-frame frame)
     (select-frame-set-input-focus frame)
     (with-current-buffer buffer
       (condition-case nil
           (unwind-protect
               ,@body
             (delete-frame frame)
             (kill-buffer buffer))
         (quit (delete-frame frame)
               (kill-buffer buffer))))))
```

Most of the snippet styles our new frame and invokes the body parameter. While I don't typically resort to macros, we get a little syntatic sugar here, so we can invoke like so:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun present-open-bookmark-frame ()
  (present (browse-url (seq-elt (split-string (completing-read "Open: " (browser-bookmarks "/private/tmp/bookmarks.org")) "\n") 1))))
```

Wrapping our one-liner with the `present-open-bookmark-frame` function enables us to easily invoke from the command line, with something like

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
emacsclient -ne "(present-open-bookmark-frame)"
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/building-your-own-bookmark-launcher/command.gif)

Now that we can easily invoke from the command line, we have the flexibility to summon from anywhere. We can even bind to a key shortcut, available anywhere (not just Emacs). I typically do this via [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/), with some helpers, though there are likely simpler options out there.

``` lua
function emacsExecute(activate, elisp)
   if activate then
      activateFirstOf({
            {
               bundleID="org.gnu.Emacs",
               name="Emacs"
            }
      })
   end

   local socket, found = emacsSocketPath()
   if not found then
      hs.alert.show("Could not get emacs socket path")
      return "", false
   end

   local output,success = hs.execute("/opt/homebrew/bin/emacsclient -ne \""..elisp.."\" -s "..socket)
   if not success then
      hs.alert.show("Emacs did not execute: "..elisp)
      return "", false
   end

   return output, success
end

function openBookmark()
   appRequestingEmacs = hs.application.frontmostApplication()
   emacsExecute(false, "(present-open-bookmark-frame)")
   activateFirstOf({
         {
            bundleID="org.gnu.Emacs",
            name="Emacs"
         }
   })
end

hs.hotkey.bind({"alt"}, "W", openBookmark)
```

With that, we have our Emacs-powered bookmark launcher, available from anywhere.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/building-your-own-bookmark-launcher/launcher.gif)

While we used our Emacs frame presenter to summon our universal bookmark launcher, we can likely the same mechanism for other purposes. Maybe a clipboard (kill ring) manager?

# \[2023-11-25 Sat\] Native Emacs/macOS UX integrations via Swift modules
---
id: native-emacsmacos-ux-integrations-via-swift-modules
---

Once you learn a little [elisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp), [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) becomes this hyper malleable editor/platform. A live playground of sorts, where almost everything is up for grabs at runtime. Throw some elisp at it, and you can customize or extend almost anything to your heart's content. I say almost, as there's a comparatively small native core, that would typically require recompiling if you wanted to make further (native) mods. But that isn't entirely true. [Emacs 25](https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/whats-new-in-emacs-25-1) enabled us to further extend things by loading native [dynamic modules](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Dynamic-Modules.html), back in 2016.

Most of my Emacs-bending adventures have been powered by elisp, primarily on macOS. I also happen to have an iOS dev background, so when [Valeriy Savchenko](https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy) [announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wemj1z/writing_emacs_dynamic_modules_in_swift/) his project bringing [Emacs dynamic modules powered by Swift](https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy/emacs-swift-module), I added it to my never-ending list of things to try out.

Fast-forward to a year later, and [Roife](https://github.com/roife)'s [introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/17vrmrk/emt_emacs_macos_tokenizer_for_enhanced_cjk_word/) to [emt](https://github.com/roife/emt) finally gave me that much-needed nudge to give [emacs-swift-module](https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy/emacs-swift-module) a try. While I wish I had done it earlier, I also wish [emacs-swift-module](https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy/emacs-swift-module) had gotten more visibility. Native extensions written in Swift can open up some some neat integrations using native macOS UX/APIs.

While I'm new to Savchenko's [emacs-swift-module](https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy/emacs-swift-module), the project has [wonderful documentation](https://savchenkovaleriy.github.io/emacs-swift-module/documentation/emacsswiftmodule/). It quickly got me on my way to build an experimental dynamic module introducing a native context menu for sharing files from my beloved editor.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/native-emacsmacos-ux-integrations-via-swift-modules/emacs-share.webp)

Most of the elisp/native bridging magic happens with fairly little Swift code:

``` swift
try env.defun(
  "macos-module--share",
  with: """
    Share files in ARG1.

    ARG1 must be a vector (not a list) of file paths.
    """
) { (env: Environment, files: [String]) in
  let urls = files.map { URL(fileURLWithPath: $0) }

  let picker = NSSharingServicePicker(items: urls)
  guard let view = NSApp.mainWindow?.contentView else {
    return
  }

  let x = try env.funcall("macos--emacs-point-x") as Int
  let y = try env.funcall("macos--emacs-point-y") as Int

  let rect = NSRect(
    x: x + 15, y: Int(view.bounds.height) - y + 15, width: 1, height: 1
  )
  picker.show(relativeTo: rect, of: view, preferredEdge: .maxY)
}
```

This produced an elisp `macos-module--share` function I could easily access from elisp like so:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun macos-share ()
  "Share file(s) with other macOS apps.

If visiting a buffer with associated file, share it.

While in `dired', any selected files, share those.  If region is
active, share files in region.  Otherwise share file at point."
  (interactive)
  (macos-module--share (vconcat (macos--files-dwim))))
```

On a side note, `(macos--files-dwim)` chooses files depending on context. That is, [do what I mean (DWIM) style](emacs-dwim-do-what-i-mean/). If there's a file associated with current buffer, share it. When in [dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html) (the directory editor, aka file manager), look at region, selected files, or default to file at point.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun macos--files-dwim ()
  "Return buffer file (if available) or marked/region files for a `dired' buffer."
  (if (buffer-file-name)
      (list (buffer-file-name))
    (or
     (macos--dired-paths-in-region)
     (dired-get-marked-files))))

(defun macos--dired-paths-in-region ()
  "If `dired' buffer, return region files.  nil otherwise."
  (when (and (equal major-mode 'dired-mode)
             (use-region-p))
    (let ((start (region-beginning))
          (end (region-end))
          (paths))
      (save-excursion
        (save-restriction
          (goto-char start)
          (while (< (point) end)
            ;; Skip non-file lines.
            (while (and (< (point) end) (dired-between-files))
              (forward-line 1))
            (when (dired-get-filename nil t)
              (setq paths (append paths (list (dired-get-filename nil t)))))
            (forward-line 1))))
      paths)))
```

I got one more example of a native macOS integration I added. Being an even simpler one, and in hindsight, I prolly should have introduced it first. In any case, this one reveals [dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html) files in macOS's Finder app (including the selection itself).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/native-emacsmacos-ux-integrations-via-swift-modules/reveal.webp)

``` swift
try env.defun(
  "macos-module--reveal-in-finder",
  with: """
    Reveal (and select) files in ARG1 in macOS Finder.

    ARG1 mus be a vector (not a list) of file paths.
    """
) { (env: Environment, files: [String]) in
  NSWorkspace.shared.activateFileViewerSelecting(files.map { URL(fileURLWithPath: $0) })
}
```

The corresponding elisp is nearly identical to its `macos-share` sibling:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun macos-reveal-in-finder ()
  "Reveal file(s) in macOS Finder.

If visiting a buffer with associated file, reveal it.

While in `dired', any selected files, reveal those.  If region is
active, reveal files in region.  Otherwise reveal file at point."
  (interactive)
  (macos-module--reveal-in-finder (vconcat (macos--files-dwim))))
```

My Swift module experiment introduces two native macOS UX integrations, now available via `M-x macos-share` and `M-x macos-reveal-in-finder`. I've pushed all code to it's own [repo](https://github.com/xenodium/EmacsMacOSModule).

I hope this post brings visibility to the wonderful [emacs-swift-module](https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy/emacs-swift-module) project and sparks new, native, and innovative integrations for those on macOS. Can't wait to see what others can do with it.

# \[2023-11-16 Thu\] Migrating/re-encrypting pass's password store
---
id: migratingre-encrypting-passs-password-store
---

Note to self, I needed to migrate/re-encrypt someone's password store (aka pass). Straightforward:

Get the new key, probably already in gpg key chain. Try listing it:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
gpg --list-keys
```

To re-encrypt, `pass init` with new key is enough. It'll prompt for old pass key.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
cd path/to/.password-store
pass init NEW-GPG-KEY
```

# \[2023-10-30 Mon\] How I smash burgers
---
id: how-i-smash-burgers
---

I'm neither a burger expert nor a connoisseur of any kind, yet I sure have a lot of fun smashing burgers at home. Needless to say, I shamelessly enjoy gobbling them too!

<figure width="60%">
<img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/burger-cut.png" />
<figcaption>my smash burger</figcaption>
</figure>

I'll share details on how I smash my burgers, but here's a quick ingredient list, if that's all you need.

-   Mince beef (20%-30% fat).
-   Streaky bacon.
-   Brioche burger buns.
-   American cheese slices (cheddar individual slices work too).
-   Lettuce.
-   Tomatoes.
-   Onions.
-   Pickles.
-   Jalapeños.
-   Garlic.
-   Chipotle powder.
-   Mayonnaise.
-   Salt.
-   Pepper.
-   Oil.
-   Greaseproof paper.
-   Butter.

## The calling

My quest to smash burgers at home didn't start until earlier this year, while watching the [The Menu](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9764362/). I just could't stop [craving the burger](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium/109734285674122246) from that scene, so I set out to start smashing my own.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/the-menu.webp)

## The gear

Don't rush to buy anything fancy. Your existing gear will likely do the job just fine. I'd say try a few things out and only upgrade when needed. I'll share the gear I use and where I felt I needed tweaking.

## Skillet

While I didn't have a griddle at home, I did have a couple of trusty [Lodge](https://www.lodgecastiron.com/) **skillets** ([cast iron](https://www.lodgecastiron.com/product/round-cast-iron-classic-skillet?sku=L8SK3) and [carbon steel](https://www.lodgecastiron.com/product/carbon-steel-skillet?sku=CRS12)). Both work great for burgers, though I have a slight preference for the carbon steel one, as it's the bigger of the two and gives a little more room for manoeuvring, specially when smashing two burgers at a time.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/cast-iron.png)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/carbon.png)

Heat the skillet up and add a little oil. If the oil starts smoking, be quick to drop the patties and start smashing.

## Grill Spatula (too big/stiff for skillet)

Somewhat inspired by the film, I got myself a wide spatula so I could firmly press those patties against the skillet, and to flip of course.

While this kind of spatula may work well on a spacious griddle, I felt constrained on a relatively small cast iron. Specially when flipping. I went looking for an alternative.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/spatula.png)

## Spatula + smasher (my winning combo)

Over at the [r/castiron](https://reddit.com/r/castiron/) subreddit, I discovered fish spatulas. They are fairly agile on cast irons but also work great for loosening burger patties before flipping.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/ready.webp)

While effective for flipping, fish spatulas are obviously no good for smashing. So I got myself a burger smasher. This combo worked well for me.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/smash.webp)

When smashing, use greaseproof paper to prevent the patties from sticking to the smasher.

## Ingredients

While I've drawn inspiration from others, I've landed on my own preferred ingredients. I'm sure that will continue changing over time. Pick and choose as your heart desires.

## Minced/ground beef

Minced beef with higher fat content (around 20-30%) is often recommended for a couple of reasons:

-   Flavour: Fat equals flavour in cooking. The higher fat content will melt during cooking and become 'self-basting', resulting in a juicier and more flavourful burger.

-   Texture: The fat in the beef melts under heat, helping the burger achieve a crispy, caramelized exterior known as the [Maillard reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction), which contrasts nicely against the soft, juicy interior.

In the UK, I can typically find minced beef with 15%-20% fat content at the main supermarkets.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/pattie.png)

Be sure to salt and pepper to taste (as in picture) on one side. Once flipped on pan, salt and pepper the other side.

## Bacon

I tend to prefer smoked streaky bacon, but hey these will be your burgers. Your burgers, your rules.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/streaky.png)

## Buns (brioche)

I hear potato buns are great for burgers. I've yet to try them. So far, I've settled for brioche. I happen to find these near me, so I've gone with them.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/brioche.png)

Butter the buns and brown on the skillet for a minute. Check the buns often. Brioche buns can burn quickly.

## American cheese

American cheese is often the burger cheese of choice.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/american-cheese.webp)

While American cheese isn't widely available in the UK, the individually wrapped orange-looking cheddar cheese slices work just fine.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/cheese.png)

## Toppings

I like my burgers with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, and occasionally jalapeños. For pickles, I typically just take cornichons and slice them up.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/toppings_x0.30.png)

## Burger sauce (chipotle/garlic/mayo)

While classic burger sauce is often made with mayo, ketchup, pickles, and mustard, I've gone fairly rogue here.

You see, I love chipotle mayo. I'm also a fan of garlic mayo, so I figured why not both? Turns out these three ingredients work great together.

I like to draw out the flavours by first mixing the garlic and chipotle with a little hot water.

-   1 garlic clove.
-   2 teaspoons of chipotle powder.
-   1 tablespoon of hot water.
-   Pinch of salt.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/sauce1.png)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/sauce2.png)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/sauce3.png)

…and then thicken with mayo.

-   1/4 cup of mayo.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/sauce4.png)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/sauce5.png)

These are very rough measurements, tweak to your preference. Make more garlicky, spicier, or soften things by adding garlic, chipotle, or mayo.

## Assembling

I like to assemble in the following order from the bottom bun up.

1.  Sauce on bottom bun.
2.  Lettuce.
3.  Tomatoes.
4.  Onions.
5.  2 patties (melted cheese on both).
6.  Bacon.
7.  Pickles.
8.  Jalapeños.
9.  Sauce on top bun (oops, I forgot in the picture).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/how-i-smash-burgers/open.png)

…and here's the final product.

# \[2023-10-24 Tue\] Open in Xcode at line number
---
id: open-in-xcode-at-line-number
---

I live mostly in Emacs. I say mostly 'cause well, I'm fairly pragmatic about it. If there's a workflow elsewhere that's more appropriate for my needs, I'll happily use that instead. While I'd love to do my web browsing from my beloved editor, Firefox ticks the right boxes for me.

I do most of my iOS coding in Emacs. It's a hybrid of sorts between Emacs and Xcode. If I need to use the debugger, Xcode is a clear winner for me. If I happen to be visiting a Swift file in an Emacs buffer, I typically used the handy `crux-open-with` from [crux](https://github.com/bbatsov/crux) to open in Xcode, and continue from there. This worked OK, but I always wished opening in Xcode would also jump to the same line number as the Emacs point (cursor) location. This is particularly useful if I had just spotted where I'd like to set a breakpoint in an Emacs buffer and need to transition over to Xcode.

It turns out, there's a nifty command line utility for that. [xed](https://www.unix.com/man-page/osx/1/xed/), the Xcode text editor invocation tool. It enables telling Xcode what file to open and at what line number:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
xed -line 141 path/to/some/file.swift
```

With that in mind, I've added my own version of `crux-open-with`, using [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command).

When running on macOS, the function checks whether or not I'm visiting a buffer for a programming language, and opens the file in Xcode at the same line number.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-commands-open-externally ()
  "Open file(s) externally."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   "Open externally"
   (if (eq system-type 'darwin)
       (if (derived-mode-p 'prog-mode)
           (format "xed --line %d '<<f>>'"
                   (line-number-at-pos (point)))
         "open '<<f>>'")
     "xdg-open '<<f>>'")
   :shell-args '("-x" "-c")
   :silent-success t
   :utils (if (eq system-type 'darwin)
              "open"
            "xdg-open")))
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/open-in-xcode-at-line-number/xed_x0.8_x2.webp)

`dwim-shell-commands-open-externally` is now [added to dwim-shell-commands.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/commit/19be1c2f3792c95f04fd369cb931a52f7df9cfd5).

ps. If you find opening the same file in a different context handy, you may also like the package [browse-at-remote](https://github.com/rmuslimov/browse-at-remote) that opens the visited file at its corresponding remote location (for example, GitHub). I can never remember the name of the function ([browse-at-remote](https://github.com/rmuslimov/browse-at-remote)), so I aliased it to something I'd remember and moved on…

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defalias 'ar/open-at-github #'browse-at-remote))
```

# \[2023-10-06 Fri\] Trimming video screenshots
---
id: trimming-video-screenshots
---

A quick one… I recently wanted to trim the black borders around a video screenshot. While I could use an image editor to manually select and trim, I wondered if there was an [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/) trick somewhere out there for such a thing… and of course there was:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
magick convert -fuzz 3% -define trim:percent-background=0% -trim +repage path/to/input.png path/to/output.png
```

Pretty neat. It does the job, but I won't remember it next time. May as well make another [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) function out of it and conveniently invoke from Emacs via a memorable name plus fuzzy search.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/trimming-video-screenshots/trim.gif)

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-commands-image-trim-borders ()
  "Trim image(s) border (useful for video screenshots)."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   "Trim image border"
   "magick convert -fuzz 3% -define trim:percent-background=0% -trim +repage '<<f>>' '<<fne>>_trimmed.<<e>>'"
   :utils "magick"))
```

While the screenshot I've just used was a little blurry, it's from the movie [Tron Legacy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1104001/), and it features Emacs eshell. This is old news, though [well covered](https://irreal.org/blog/?p=9573).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/trimming-video-screenshots/eshell_trimmed.png)

`dwim-shell-commands-image-trim-borders` is now [added to dwim-shell-commands.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/commit/5bed2f6b40761db4913c8d8f58bb147c71a9ceb7)

# \[2023-10-06 Fri\] Displaying image details in mode line
---
id: displaying-image-details-in-mode-line
---

A benefit of running Emacs as a GUI app, is that you can view images from your beloved editor. This is super handy to take a quick peek at any image.

Sometimes, I'd like a little more than just viewing the image. I'd like to see basic image details like type, dimensions, and file size. The [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/) `identify` utility is pretty handy for that.

``` bash
identify -format "%m %wx%h %b" path/to/image.png
```

I could easily invoke `shell-command` for this or even create a [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) function (maybe I will), but if this info was proactively displayed in the mode line, I wouldn't have to fetch it myself.

Since I know I can use the `identify` command for this, I may as well see if I can plug it into the mode line.

Turns out this wasn't too bad by setting `setting mode-line-format`. I added a little logic to only include image details while in `image-mode` and rely on `process-lines` to fetch the details. This function returns a list, which is a happy coincidence since `mode-line-format` also expects a list.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(setq-default mode-line-format
              '(" "
                mode-line-front-space
                mode-line-client
                mode-line-frame-identification
                mode-line-buffer-identification
                (:eval
                 (when (eq major-mode 'image-mode)
                   ;; Needs imagemagick installed.
                   (process-lines "identify" "-format" "[%m %wx%h %b]" (buffer-file-name))))
                " "
                mode-line-position
                (vc-mode vc-mode)
                (multiple-cursors-mode mc/mode-line)
                " " mode-line-modes
                mode-line-end-spaces))
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/displaying-image-details-in-mode-line/buddies.png)

I'd love to hear if there's a pure elisp alternative ([mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium)/[twitter](https://twitter.com/xenodium)). I gave `(image-size (image-get-display-property) :pixels)` a try, but that seemed to return the display size in buffer rather than actual file size.

id: creating-icloud-test-accounts
---

*UPDATE: This method no longer works for creating iCloud accounts. I'd love to know if you find an alternative. Please let me know.*

I wanted an additional \@icloud.com account for myself. My first thought was to head over to <https://developer.apple.com> and create a new account, but that requires an existing email address. I wanted an actual \@icloud.com email address.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/creating-icloud-test-accounts/web.png)

My next thought was to create a new account using the iOS simulator, but that complained about creating too many accounts already. Strange, as I hadn't created any.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/creating-icloud-test-accounts/iphone.png)

I could create an account from macOS settings itself, though that would require logging out my current account (and the syncing implications). To get around that, I could maybe create a temporary macOS user. Instead, I somewhat revisited the simulator route and looked for a VM option to run macOS. This gave me an excuse to play with VM options on macOS.

I had been meaning to check out [lima](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima) as per Hacker News's [Lima: A nice way to run Linux VMs on Mac](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36668964). The Hacker News's [thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36668964) has a handful of great recommendations. Amongst them, [tart](https://github.com/cirruslabs/tart/) (macOS and Linux VMs on Apple Silicon) stood out, as it also gave me the Mac on Mac option.

Installing `tart` via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) followed the typical `brew` command… a breeze via my trusty Emacs [eshell](https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/complete-guide-mastering-eshell):

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install cirruslabs/cli/tart
```

Cloning a VM image, while straightforward, it did take a little while for the chunky download:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
tart clone ghcr.io/cirruslabs/macos-sonoma-base:latest sonoma-base
```

Running the macOS Sonoma VM was a breeze:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
tart run sonoma-base
```

…and with that, I got a full (and disposable) macOS VM I can use to create another \@icloud.com account:

While there may be simpler options out there to create an \@icloud.com account (please do let me know [mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium)/[twitter](https://twitter.com/xenodium)), the VM did the job. I'd been meaning to find a low friction mechanism to run VMs for a different reason, but that's a post for another time.

# \[2023-09-16 Sat\] Emacs hangs saving .authinfo.gpg (workaround)
---
id: emacs-hangs-saving-authinfogpg-workaround
---

My Emacs (v29.1) was hanging when saving changes to .authinfo.gpg. Turns out, I ran into a [known issue](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/etc/PROBLEMS?id=1b9812af80b6ceec8418636dbf84c0fbcd3ab694) with a workaround. Downgrading gnupgp to a version older than 2.4.1 sorts things out.

I'm on macOS. Downgraded by downloading the 2.4.0 Homebrew formula at <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/59edfe598541186430d49cc34f42671e849e2fc9/Formula/gnupg.rb> and installing with:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew unlink gnupg
brew install ~/Downloads/gnupg.rb
```

# \[2023-09-15 Fri\] Redact that buffer
---
id: redact-that-buffer
---

As I was getting ready to take an Emacs screenshot in the [previous post](emacs-send-to-kindle/), I figured I may want to redact email addresses before moving forward. I had a quick look for existing options and found [redacted.el](https://github.com/bkaestner/redacted.el), built-in `toggle-rot13-mode`, and [unpackaged/lorem-ipsum-overlay](https://github.com/alphapapa/unpackaged.el#obfuscate-buffer-text-with-lorem-ipsum-words). All great options. I wanted a solution I could feed a single regular expression to obscure matches. I also wanted toggling capabilities, so I had a quick go at it…

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/redact-that-buffer/redact-regexp.gif)

I also wanted the ability to redact the entire buffer content, so feeding a space to the regexp query also translates to `[[:graph:]]`, effectively redacting all visible characters.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/redact-that-buffer/redact-all.gif)

The solution is overlay-based, ensuring the buffer content remains unchanged. The function may have its own rough edges, yet it certainly scratched the itch for the current need. I'll leave ya with the snippet.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun ar/toggle-redact-buffer ()
  "Redact buffer content matching regexp. A space redacts all."
  (interactive)
  (let* ((redacted)
         (regexp (string-trim (read-regexp "Redact regexp" 'regexp-history-last)))
         (matches (let ((results '()))
                    (when (string-empty-p regexp)
                      (setq regexp "[[:graph:]]")
                      (setq regexp-history-last regexp)
                      (add-to-history 'regexp-history regexp))
                    (save-excursion
                      (goto-char (point-min))
                      (while (re-search-forward regexp nil t)
                        (push (cons (match-beginning 0) (match-end 0)) results)))
                    (nreverse results))))
    (mapc (lambda (match)
            (dolist (overlay (overlays-in (car match) (cdr match)))
              (setq redacted t)
              (delete-overlay overlay))
            (unless redacted
              (overlay-put (make-overlay (car match) (cdr match))
                           'display (make-string (- (cdr match) (car match)) ?x))))
          matches)))
```

# \[2023-09-15 Fri\] Send note to Kindle
---
id: emacs-send-to-kindle

While on Mastodon, I spotted [\@summeremacs](https://indieweb.social/@summeremacs@fashionsocial.host) looking into [sending Emacs text selections to a Kindle via email](https://indieweb.social/@summeremacs@fashionsocial.host/111058226788825431). This sparked my interest as I previously looked into [sending pdfs to my Kindle](emailing-pdfs-to-kindle-from-mu4e/) via [mu4e](https://github.com/djcb/mu).

Kindle offers a neat service where you can email a file to your `@kindle.com` address and it automatically shows up in your Kindle library.

I already do email from my beloved editor, and like most Emacs things, it's powered by [elisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp). In other words, it's basically up for grabs if you'd like to glue it to anything else, so I did…

I can now select a region and invoke `M-x send-to-kindle-as-txt` to send it over to my Kindle.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-send-to-kindle/send-to-my-kindle.gif)

Soon enough, the note shows up on my Kindle.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-send-to-kindle/listed.png)

Opening the note reveals the same content we had previously selected and sent from our malleable editor.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-send-to-kindle/repeated.png)

While it looks kinda magical, it's fairly simple under the hood. It takes the region content, writes it to a txt file, creates an email message buffer attaching the file, and finally sends via `message-send-and-exit`.

If `M-x send-to-kindle-as-txt` is invoked with a `C-u` prefix, you get to inspect the message buffer right before sending via `C-c C-c`.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-send-to-kindle/email.png)

Here's the full snippet.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defcustom send-to-kindle-from-email
  nil
  "Your own email address to send from via mu4e."
  :type 'string

  (unless send-to-kindle-to-email

          (read-string "To email address: ")))
  (let* ((content (string-trim (if (region-active-p)
                                   (buffer-substring (region-beginning) (region-end))
                                 (buffer-string))))
         (note-name (let ((name (string-trim (read-string "Note name: "))))
                      (if (string-empty-p name)
                          (nth
                           0 (string-split
                              (substring content 0 (min 40 (length content))) "\n"))
                        name)))
         (path (concat (temporary-file-directory) note-name))
         (txt (concat path ".txt"))
         (buffer (get-buffer-create (generate-new-buffer-name "*Email txt*"))))
    (with-temp-buffer
      (insert content)
      (write-file txt))
    (with-current-buffer buffer
      (erase-buffer)

      (let ((message-mode-hook nil))
        (message-mode))

        send-to-kindle-from-email
        send-to-kindle-to-email
        note-name txt))
      (unless review
        (message-send-and-exit)))
    (when review
      (switch-to-buffer buffer))))
```

By the way, and I only just learned this today… To take a screenshot on a Kindle Paperwhite, tap on these opposite corners.

# \[2023-09-10 Sun\] SHA-256 hash from URL, the easy way
---
id: sha-256-hash-from-url-the-easy-way
---

From time to time, I need to generate a SHA-256 hash from a file hosted on some server. For me, this flow typically goes something along the lines of:

-   Copy the file URL from browser.
-   Drop to Emacs eshell.
-   Change current directory.
-   Type "curl -o file"
-   Paste the file URL.
-   Run curl command.
-   Type "shasum -a 256 file".
-   Run [shasum](https://linux.die.net/man/1/shasum) command.
-   Copy the generated hash.
-   Maybe delete the downloaded file?

We can maybe shave some steps off by downloading directly from the browser, though that may also bring additional clicks and navigating to a download location.

Amongst the steps, [shasum](https://linux.die.net/man/1/shasum) is the star player, and its output can be seen below.

``` bash
shasum -a 256 path/to/downloaded/file
```

Not a huge deal. One can copy the hash from the output, but why go through multiple small manual steps when I know I can get Emacs to simplify the lot? I've expedited a similar flow in the past when [cloning git repos](emacs-clone-git-repo-from-clipboard/). Let's simplify again so hashing a hosted file boils down to:

-   Copy the file URL from browser.
-   Run an Emacs interactive command.

This is where I pull out [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) (a little package I wrote) and glue the lot to get an expedited experience.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/sha-256-hash-from-url-the-easy-way/hash.gif)

There isn't much to the function other than glueing a little elisp and a shell script via `dwim-shell-command` for some buffer/error handling.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-commands-sha-256-hash-file-at-clipboard-url ()
  "Download file at clipboard URL and generate SHA-256 hash."
  (interactive)
  (let ((url (current-kill 0)))
    (unless (string-match-p "^http[s]?://" url)
      (user-error "No URL in clipboard"))
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "Generate SHA-256 hash from clipboard URL."
     (format
      "temp_file=$(mktemp)
       function cleanup {
         rm -f $temp_file
       }
       trap cleanup EXIT
       curl --no-progress-meter --location --fail --output $temp_file %s || exit 1
       shasum -a 256 $temp_file | awk '{print $1}'"
      (shell-quote-argument url))
     :utils '("curl" "shasum")
     :on-completion
     (lambda (buffer process)
       (if-let ((success (= (process-exit-status process) 0))
                (hash (with-current-buffer buffer
                        (string-trim (buffer-string)))))
           (progn
             (kill-buffer buffer)
             (kill-new hash)
             (message "Copied %s to clipboard"
                      (propertize hash 'face 'font-lock-string-face)))
         (switch-to-buffer buffer))))))
```

`dwim-shell-commands-sha-256-hash-file-at-clipboard-url` is now in [dwim-shell-commands.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-commands.el), the optional counterpart in [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/).

## UPDATE

There's better way. Thanks to [Philip Kaludercic](https://emacs.ch/@pkal) for [suggesting](https://emacs.ch/@pkal/111041928308815477) `curl -s example.com | sha256sum - | cut -d " " -f1` and [Sacha Chua](https://emacs.ch/@sachac) who pinged me about it.

Also note I'm now relying on the `<<cb>>` template, since dwim-shell-command replaces it with the clipboard/kill ring.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-commands-sha-256-hash-file-at-clipboard-url ()
  "Download file at clipboard URL and generate SHA-256 hash."
  (interactive)
  (unless (string-match-p "^http[s]?://" (current-kill 0))
    (user-error "No URL in clipboard"))
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   "Generate SHA-256 hash from clipboard URL."
   "curl -s '<<cb>>' | sha256sum - | cut -d ' ' -f1"
   :utils '("curl" "sha256sum")
   :on-completion
   (lambda (buffer process)
     (if-let ((success (= (process-exit-status process) 0))
              (hash (with-current-buffer buffer
                      (string-trim (buffer-string)))))
         (progn
           (kill-buffer buffer)
           (kill-new hash)
           (message "Copied %s to clipboard"
                    (propertize hash 'face 'font-lock-string-face)))
       (switch-to-buffer buffer)))))
```

# \[2023-09-05 Tue\] Inline previous result and why you should edebug
---
id: inline-previous-result-and-why-you-should-edebug
---

Artur Malabarba's [Debugging Elisp Part 1: Earn your independence](https://endlessparentheses.com/debugging-emacs-lisp-part-1-earn-your-independence.html) is nearly a decade old, yet it rings just as true today.

Learning to Edebug really *"is the right decision for anyone who doesn't know how to Edebug."* Why, you may ask? He best puts it as *"running into errors is not only a consequence of tinkering with your editor, it is the only road to graduating in Emacs."*

For me personally, it *earned me that independence* to bend Emacs my way. Don't like how something works? Pull up the debugger to help me understand how a package or function works. I've done this countless of times to bend things my way.

Speaking of edebug, I had been meaning to tweak edebug's result display behaviour for quite some time. As you step through code, edbug prints the result of previous expressions to the minibuffer. This works well, but I couldn't help but feel like my eyes were constantly jumping between the code and the minibuffer at the bottom of the window.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/inline-previous-result-and-why-you-should-edebug/edebug-minibuffer.gif)

I wanted to minimize the eye jumping experience, so I figured I could likely bend things my way and print the result at point. How did I go about it? The same way I often do. Figure out what function is called for a given key binding via [describe-key](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Key-Help.html) or my favourite replacement helpful-key from [helpful.el](https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful). This led me to `edebug-next-mode` in `edebug.el`. At that point, I could have set a breakpoint in `edebug-next-mode` and eventually step into the relevant code, but hey we had a better clue. We knew that all output started with "Result:", so we could just search for that string in `edebug.el` instead. Jackpot! `edebug-compute-previous-result` and its adjacent `edebug-previous-result` are just the right functions:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun edebug-compute-previous-result (previous-value)
  (if edebug-unwrap-results
      (setq previous-value
            (edebug-unwrap* previous-value)))
  (setq edebug-previous-result
        (concat "Result: "
                (edebug-safe-prin1-to-string previous-value)
                (eval-expression-print-format previous-value))))

(defun edebug-previous-result ()
  "Print the previous result."
  (interactive)
  (message "%s" edebug-previous-result))
```

We can see that `edebug-previous-result` invokes `message` which is responsible for displaying the debugged expression's result in the minibuffer. Modifying this functions behaviour would be enough to achieve inline display, but I also want to remove "Result:" from the displayed message. Neither of these functions offer configurability, so we'll resort to advising both functions. That is, [monkey patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch) them (errm I know… lovely).

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun adviced:edebug-compute-previous-result (_ &rest r)
  "Adviced `edebug-compute-previous-result'."
  (let ((previous-value (nth 0 r)))
    (if edebug-unwrap-results
        (setq previous-value
              (edebug-unwrap* previous-value)))
    (setq edebug-previous-result
          (edebug-safe-prin1-to-string previous-value))))

(advice-add #'edebug-compute-previous-result
            :around
            #'adviced:edebug-compute-previous-result)
```

`adviced:edebug-compute-previous-result` removes "Result:" in addition to dropping `(eval-expression-print-format previous-value)`, which I don't typically rely on.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(require 'eros)

(defun adviced:edebug-previous-result (_ &rest r)
  "Adviced `edebug-previous-result'."
  (eros--make-result-overlay edebug-previous-result
    :where (point)
    :duration eros-eval-result-duration))

(advice-add #'edebug-previous-result
            :around
            #'adviced:edebug-previous-result)
```

`adviced:edebug-previous-result` is in charge of display via `message`, so all we need is some replacement. I initially played with [popup-tip](https://github.com/auto-complete/popup-el) and that [did the job just fine](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium/111008598580447299), but [Colin](https://emacs.ch/@fosskers) led me to a better path while [pointing to Clojure and Common Lisp](https://emacs.ch/@fosskers/111009811997698187). This reminded me of [eros: Evaluation Result OverlayS for Emacs Lisp](https://github.com/xiongtx/eros), which I already used. Swapping `message` for `eros--make-result-overlay` did the trick. Yes, this is a private function, but I can live with that. This code is only an `advice-remove` away from disabling, but hey look at those *inline results*!

# \[2023-08-27 Sun\] Further sqlite-mode extensions

id: further-sqlite-mode-extensions

I've continued poking at Emacs 29's sqlite-mode. Since [my last post on extensions](sqlite-mode-goodies/), I've experimented a little with adding a handful of interactive functions:

-   `sqlite-mode-extras-compose-and-execute`: Compose and execute a query.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/further-sqlite-mode-extensions/compose-execute.gif)

-   `sqlite-mode-extras-execute`: Execute a query.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/further-sqlite-mode-extensions/execute.gif)

-   `sqlite-mode-extras-add-row`: Add row to table at point.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/further-sqlite-mode-extensions/add-row.gif)

-   `sqlite-mode-extras-delete-row-dwim`: Similar to `sqlite-mode-delete` but also enables deleting range in region.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/further-sqlite-mode-extensions/delete-rows.gif)

-   `sqlite-mode-extras-refresh`: Refreshes the buffer re-querying the database.
-   `sqlite-mode-extras-ret-dwim`: If on table, toggle expansion. If on row, edit it.
-   `sqlite-mode-extras-execute-and-display-select-query`: Executes a query and displays results.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/further-sqlite-mode-extensions/select-earth.gif)

```

The code lives in [sqlite-mode-extras.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/ar/sqlite-mode-extras.el) under my [Emacs config repo](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/tree/main). Beware, it's fairly experimental and hasn't been tested thoroughly.

# \[2023-08-22 Tue\] My custom Tesco Clubcard pkpass
---
id: my-custom-tesco-clubcard-pkpass
---

My significant other and I had two plastic Tesco Clubcards. I lost mine, so I took a picture of hers. I was fairly certain a barcode photo would scan just as well at self-checkout, and it did.

This got me thinking about Apple's Wallet [pkpasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKPASS). I don't really know much about them. Could I potentially create my own `.pkpass`? If I could just include the same barcode as in the photo, it should do the job just fine.

Now I should mention, [Tesco does have an app on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/tesco-grocery-clubcard/id389581236). If you just want the official Wallet pass on your iPhone, use that. But I was curious about whether or not I could create my own pass.

Turns out I *can*. I followed Apple's [building your first pass](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/PassKit_PG/YourFirst.html) which runs you through [creating Wallet identifiers/certificates](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/configure-app-capabilities/create-wallet-identifiers-and-certificates), editing `pass.json`, and downloading/building [signpass](https://developer.apple.com/services-account/download?path=/iOS/Wallet_Support_Materials/WalletCompanionFiles.zip) (the utility used to sign `.pass` bundles).

The `signpass` utility is included in WalletCompanionFiles.zip, which comes with a handful of sample passes.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
WalletCompanionFiles
│
├── SamplePasses
│   │
│   ├── BoardingPass.pass
│   ├── Coupon.pass
│   ├── Event.pass
│   ├── Event.pkpass
│   ├── Generic.pass
│   └── StoreCard.pass
│       │
│       ├── pass.json
│       └── ...
└── signpass
```

Being a rewards card, I opted to look into `StoreCard.pass`, but like all other passes, the `barcode` itself is what makes each pass scannable. The barcode details are specified in the bundles's `pass.json` file. I needed to figure out the relevant values describing the Tesco barcode.

``` json
"barcode": {
  "format": "???",
  "message": "???",
  "messageEncoding": "???"
}
```

I had no clue what values I should use for a Tesco Clubcard. I did, however, have a photo of the barcode I needed. This is in fact what prompted looking into [scanning barcodes from Emacs](emacs-scan-this-qrcode), which worked just great. It gave me all the crucial bits for the Clubcard.

``` json
"barcode": {
  "format": "PKBarcodeFormatCode128",
  "message": "1234567890123456",  // not my actual Clubcard number of course.
  "messageEncoding": "iso-8859-1"
}
```

That's all that's needed for the barcode section, the most useful part of the pass. We're not done though. We also need our registered Wallet identifiers, so the `signpass` utility can sign.

``` json
"passTypeIdentifier": "my.com.identifier.passmaker", // also not my actual one.
"teamIdentifier": "AAABBBCCCD", // nor this one.
```

We should be able to sign the pass with the following:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
signpass -p StoreCard.pass
```

We're technically done. We now have a working card, but it looks just like the sample store card included in WalletCompanionFiles.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/my-custom-tesco-clubcard-pkpass/lemons.png)

What's the fun in that? Now that I can make my own Clubcard, let's customize it!

For imagery, I replaced a couple of images in the .pass bundle:

``` c
StoreCard.pass
│
├── pass.json
├── icon.png
├── logo.png // replaced
└── strip.png // replaced
```

I replaced `logo.png` using a [Tesco logo I found on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tesco_Logo.svg). I had initially removed `strip.png`, but that made the card feel a little empty. I was thinking of using a Tesco carrier bag to bulk the space up. While I didn't find a suitable bag image, I did land on "[Very Little Helps, 2008](https://banksyexplained.com/very-little-helps-2008/)". Using my limited [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) skills, I cropped one of the images and also replaced `strip.png`.

The remaining customizations took place in `pass.json` and should be fairly self-explanatory. There's the text shown in all labels as well as three customizable colours (background, label, and foreground).

``` json
{
  "formatVersion": 1,
  "passTypeIdentifier": "my.com.identifier.passmaker", // also not my actual one.
  "teamIdentifier": "AAABBBCCCD", // nor this one.
  "serialNumber": "AnySerialNumberYouWant",
  "barcode": {
    "format": "PKBarcodeFormatCode128",
    "message": "1234567890123456",
    "messageEncoding": "iso-8859-1"
  },
  "organizationName": "Not Tesco of course",
  "description": "Not a Tesco reqards card",
  "logoText": "Clubcard",
  "foregroundColor": "rgb(255, 255, 255)",
  "labelColor": "rgb(255, 255, 255)",
  "backgroundColor": "rgb(2, 81, 158)", // Blue for that Tesco look
  "storeCard": {
    "auxiliaryFields": [
      {
        "key": "membership",
        "label": "Member since 2023",
        "value": ""
      },
      {
        "key": "membership2",
        "label": "Expires sometime",
        "value": ""
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

…and with all that, here's what my very own custom Tesco Clubcard pkpass looks like. As you can appreciate, my image-editing skills aren't all that great, but hey this will do for now.

## Update

Redditor u/stupergenius [suggested using the image's original background color](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/15y4c65/comment/jxa1obg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Nice suggestion. Tweaked via pass.json:

``` json
"foregroundColor": "rgb(2, 81, 158)",
"labelColor": "rgb(15, 58, 105)",
"backgroundColor": "rgb(166, 202, 214)",

# \[2023-08-07 Mon\] Extending sqlite-mode (cell navigation + edits)
---
id: sqlite-mode-goodies
---

I recently [wrote about Emacs 29's new sqlite-mode](emacs-29s-sqlite-mode/), which enables you to browse sqlite databases from your beloved editor.

Out of the box, it supports the following browsing features:

-   `sqlite-mode-list-data`: List the data from the table under point.
-   `sqlite-mode-list-column`: List the columns of the table under point.
-   `sqlite-mode-list-tables`: Re-list the tables from the currently selected database.

On the editing side of things it supports row deletion:

-   `sqlite-mode-delete`: Delete the row under point.

While fairly spartan, it lays foundations for additional tools and features.

Two features I would like to have:

1.  TAB navigation across table rows and columns.
2.  Updating the row's field at point.

This would give me the familiar behaviour I'm used to in my org tables as well as other common spreadsheet tools.

Luckily, this is Emacs, so we can bend it our way… and I sure did!

Here's tab navigating forward:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/sqlite-mode-goodies/sqlite-forward.gif)

Here's tab navigating backward:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/sqlite-mode-goodies/sqlite-previous.gif)

And updating row fields:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/sqlite-mode-goodies/sqlite-edits.gif)

Most of the navigation is achieved by querying the current buffer to figure out column positions. Editing was in some ways easier, as I looked at `sqlite-mode-delete` to figure out how it handled the query.

To get the more familiar navigation behaviour, I've adjusted my key bindings as follows:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(use-package sqlite-mode-extras
  :bind (:map
         sqlite-mode-map
         ("n" . next-line)
         ("p" . previous-line)
         ("<backtab>" . sqlite-mode-extras-backtab-dwim)
         ("<tab>" . sqlite-mode-extras-tab-dwim)
         ("RET" . sqlite-mode-extras-ret-dwim)))
```

The code for `sqlite-mode-extras-tab-dwim`, `sqlite-mode-extras-backtab-dwim`, and `sqlite-mode-extras-ret-dwim` is little rough still (hacky even), but hey still fun.

For now, the code lives in [sqlite-mode-extras.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/ar/sqlite-mode-extras.el) under my [Emacs config repo](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/tree/main). Improvements/fixes totally welcome!

# \[2023-08-06 Sun\] Emacs 29's sqlite-mode
---
id: emacs-29s-sqlite-mode
---

I've jumped on the Emacs 29 bandwagon! Mickey Petersen has a great rundown of [What's New in Emacs 29.1](https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/whats-new-in-emacs-29-1).

Now every so often, I need to take a quick peek at an [sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) table. Emacs 29.1 ships [sqlite-mode](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Database.html), which can help with that. Use `sqlite-mode-open-file` to open a database.

Pressing `RET` on a table shows its content via `sqlite-mode-list-data`. `DEL` does as you'd expect and delete a row via `sqlite-mode-delete`.

# \[2023-07-30 Sun\] Emacs: scan this QR/bar code
---
id: emacs-scan-this-qrcode
---

Another day, another tool brought to my Emacs fingertips. A while ago, I wrote about easily [copying text from desktop to mobile via QR codes](copy-from-desktop-to-mobile-via-qr-code/). Later on, I brought it under [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) as [dwim-shell-commands-clipboard-to-qr](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/67da65f97d7f5477e19407d25887c23fab31517d/dwim-shell-commands.el#L593).

This time around, I needed the opposite: to scan a code from an image file. This is where [zbar](https://github.com/mchehab/zbar)'s `zbarimg` comes in. These days, I'm mostly on macOS, so I installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
$ brew install zbar
```

There's really nothing to the command. You feed it an image, and it outputs the scanned details. Perfect.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
$ zbarimg path/to/code-128.png
CODE-128:hello world
scanned 1 barcode symbols from 1 images in 0.02 seconds
```

The only challenge is my brain. I probably won't remember the name of this wonderful tool next time I need it, so I'll just add it to my [dwim-shell-commands.el arsenal](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-commands.el) with a memorable name:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-commands-image-scan-code ()
  "Scan any code from image(s)."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   "Scan code"
   "zbarimg '<<f>>'"
   :utils "zbarimg"))
```

In the future, rather than reaching out to `zbarimg` directly, I'll use my trusty fuzzy search and… voilà!

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-scan-this-qrcode/scan-dired.gif)

Because `dwim-shell-command` operates on either `dired` files or current file, we can also apply our new function when viewing the QR code itself.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-scan-this-qrcode/scan-image.gif)

`dwim-shell-commands-image-scan-code` is now [pushed to dwim-shell-commands.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/commit/85ebcb0a466ddfe48e543d585e16aff7aee8da5e), the optional package in [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/).

# \[2023-07-25 Tue\] A cure for JavaScript fatigue?
---
id: a-cure-for-javascript-fatigue
---

It's been roughly a decade since I wrote any significant amount of JavaScript. Back then, I primarily relied on the [Google Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/), now maybe an archaeological artefact? These days, it's hard not to bump into any JavaScript project that doesn't rely on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), along with many other tools like the [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) compiler, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)… There are a ton of available frameworks too. I was somewhat put off (or maybe just lazy?) by the initial ramp-up to reenter the JavaScript world. I guess that's what some refer to as [Javascript Fatigue](https://medium.com/@ericclemmons/javascript-fatigue-48d4011b6fc4#.prcj59904).

I'm giving JavaScript another try, but this time with an Emacs [chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell) standing by. Reentering the JavaScript world as a noob, I often know what I want to enable, but I'm unfamiliar with which project knobs to turn to set things up.

While I may want to dig deeper into things in the future, at present I just want to dabble with JavaScript. I want a local project set up as quickly as possible. ChatGPT has been pretty handy at that. The Emacs ChatGPT shell and its minibuffer prompts work fairly well for my needs, yet I often found myself wishing it could behave more like a [magit](https://magit.vc/) commit buffer. That is, launch a dedicated buffer (not the shell itself), ask the question, maybe paste some snippets, and send it on its way with that oh so familiar and satisfying `C-c C-c` binding ([sending mail](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Sending-Mail.html) also says hello).

This is where `M-x chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose` comes in. It's a mash between the ChatGPT shell and a magit commit buffer:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-cure-for-javascript-fatigue/node-chatgpt.gif)

In the background, the buffer is still powered by the shell itself, so you can reuse it to ask clarifying questions.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-cure-for-javascript-fatigue/compose.gif)

A couple of additional features worth mentioning… Invoking `chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose` with an active region automatically copies the region content over to the compose buffer. This is handy if you'd like to create more elaborate prompts with further editing. So far, this feels more natural than editing text from the shell or the minibuffer, where `RET` doesn't insert new lines.

The compose buffer is powered by a background shell (storing history for us). Typing `clear` followed by `C-c C-c` clears the background shell history.

`chatgpt-shell-prompt-compose` is available in [chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell) v0.72.1. I've so far bound it to `C-c C-e`, though I've already found some unfortunate clashes.

It may even [warm your place up](https://github.com/johanvts/emacs-fireplace) during the winter. Can [meme with you](https://github.com/TeMPOraL/nyan-mode).

You know what I mean? *[Sir, this is a Wendy's](https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/guides/what-does-sir-this-is-a-wendys-mean)*.

Luckily, we also have the built-in Emacs psychotherapist we can chat to, courtesy of [M-x doctor](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Amusements.html). It's powered by [elisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp), and like all Emacs things, it's basically up for grabs. What I mean is, elisp implements many of these features, but also glues the lot for you. Once you learn a little elisp, you can build new Emacs features but also glue others for that magical compound effect.

A little while ago, I wanted to give [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) a try, preferably from Emacs (of course). I figured a shell interface would be a great fit for the interaction. Emacs already shipped with a general command interpreter ([comint](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shell-Prompts.html)), so I cobbled together a [ChatGPT Emacs shell](a-chatgpt-emacs-shell/).

So where am I going with all this? The fine netizens [r/emaphis](https://www.reddit.com/user/emaphis/) and [salgernon](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=salgernon) both planted a great seed:

-   *"[Now for extra-credit, add the ability for Alt-X doctor to psychoanalyze Chat-GPT](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/11wdub9/comment/jczrlt7)"*.
-   *"[So how about a quick M-x psychoanalyze-chatgpt?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35259022)"*

I haven't forgotten about you. Let's take [chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell), *M-x doctor*, our versatile elisp glue, and let's make them talk:

![courtesy of [thriveth](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/122nm9r/comment/jdv9f1i) and [dr.dk](https:/asset.dr.dk/imagescaler01/downol.dr.dk/download/bonanza/thumbs/000026814.jpg).](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chatgpt-visits-the-emacs-doctor/000026814.jpg)

There isn't too much to the code, but beware:

1.  If you want to run it, you'll need chatgpt-shell [installed and set up](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell#install).
2.  This was a quick fun hack. No code judging ;)

The snippet is further down… Start with `chatgpt-shell-visit-doctor` as the entry point, setting things up for us. It creates both the `*chatgpt*` and `*doctor*` buffers and arranges the windows next to each other.

We also set a ChatGPT system prompt to guide things a little:

> "Pretend to be an overwhelmed Emacs user who is obsessed with configuring their init.el file. You are in a session talking to a psychotherapist. Limit your output to no more than 20 words. In the course of 5 exchanges between you and the therapist, show improvements. On the 8th exchange after therapist speaks, declare you are cured and only output 'Thank you doc, I think I'm cured!'"

ChatGPT and Emacs doctor can go on and on, so we limit ChatGPT responses to 20 words per response and 8 exchanges. We don't want the session to abruptly end without a resolution, so we'll use *Thank you doc, I think I'm cured!* as our key phrase to end the session.

We register `chatgpt-shell--on-chatgpt-patient-response` as a hook to receive ChatGPT output, which we feed to the `*doctor*` buffer. We subsequently get a doctor response that's fed back to ChatGPT via `chatgpt-shell--insert-doc-response`.

We add some additional freebies like binding `Ctrl-c Ctrl-c` to `chatgpt-shell-leave-doctor`, so we can bail out of the exchange from the `*chatgpt*` buffer.

We also introduced `chatgpt-shell--insert-delayed-text` as a replacement for [insert](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Insertion.html) to slow things down a little. For visual effects, really.

> I am the psychotherapist. Please, describe your problems. Each time you are finished talking, type RET twice.
>
> I spend hours tweaking my Emacs config, but it's never perfect. I'm overwhelmed and obsessed with customization.
>
> Is it because it's not ever perfect you are overwhelmed and obsessed with customization that you came to me?
>
> Yes, I can't stop myself from constantly trying to tweak and improve my Emacs configuration. It's consuming me.
>
> Emacs? Hah! I would appreciate it if you would continue.
>
> Sorry about that. Yes, I came to you because I'm overwhelmed by my obsession with customizing my Emacs configuration.
>
> Does it bother you that you are overwhelmed by your obsession with customizing your emacs configuration?
>
> Absolutely! I feel trapped in an endless cycle of tweaking and configuring, unable to achieve satisfaction.
>
> Why do you say that?
>
> I constantly seek perfection in my Emacs config, but it's an unattainable goal that leaves me exhausted and frustrated.
>
> When did you first know that it's an unattainable goal that leaves you exhausted and frustrated?
>
> I've realized it recently after spending countless hours trying to perfect my Emacs configuration without any lasting satisfaction.
>
> Are you sure?
>
> Thanks you doc, I think I'm cured.

While we can work exclusively with the `*doctor*` buffer making requests directly to the ChatGPT API, where's the fun in that? Getting the buffers to talk to each other enables us to marvel at both the beauty and absurdity of being able to glue anything together in our lovely Emacs world.

Happy Emacsing!

# \[2023-07-09 Sun\] chatgpt-shell v0.60.1 updates
---
id: chatgpt-shell-v0601-updates
---

Back in April, I shared [chatgpt-shell updates](chatgpt-shell-available-on-melpa/), showcasing [chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell) features. It's been a little while, so here's an update with the latest additions.

Like this project? Consider ✨[sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/xenodium)✨.

## Multi-session support

You can run multiple shell instances independently configured to use different versions or system prompts.

This was biggest recent change. Please report issues.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chatgpt-shell-v0601-updates/cat-turtle.gif)

## Display system prompt and version

The current shell's version and system prompt are now displayed more prominently in both the shell prompt and buffer name.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chatgpt-shell-v0601-updates/display.png)

With multi-session support, displaying shell details in the buffer name becomes more important as it makes it easier to find shells across your buffer list.

## Rename shell buffers

While buffer names are now automatically derived, one can also use `chatgpt-shell-rename-buffer` to use custom buffer names.

## ob-chatgpt-shell improvements

Use `:temperature` to specify the [temperature](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create#completions/create-temperature).

Use `:context CONTEXT-NAME` to pick and choose which source blocks to aggregate as context. Thank you [Thomas Moulia](https://github.com/jtmoulia).

Use `:preflight t` to debug `ob-chatgpt-shell` execution.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chatgpt-shell-v0601-updates/preflight.png)

## chatgpt-shell-write-git-commit

Adds `chatgpt-shell-write-git-commit`, so you can generate commit messages using the current region. Thank you [Simon Judd](https://github.com/bigsky77).

## Approximate context length

`chatgpt-shell` now uses `chatgpt-shell--approximate-context-length` to approximate the context size and discard history if necessary. This is pretty experimental but seems to work well enough. It's enabled by default to get some feedback. Please file bugs if needed or send PRs to improve.

## `S-<return>` for multiline input

In addition to `C-J` to insert multi-line input, `S-<return>` is also supported. Thank you [shouya](https://github.com/shouya) for the submission.

## Welcome message

A welcome message now makes the help much more discoverable for new or sporadic users. Thank you [shouya](https://github.com/shouya) for the suggestion.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chatgpt-shell-v0601-updates/welcome.png)

## Help me

While the [README](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell) documents the shells and Emacs is [self-documenting](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SelfDocumentation), we now have a `help` command to make things a little more discoverable.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chatgpt-shell-v0601-updates/help.png)

## Hello chatgpt-shell-mode and dall-e-shell-mode

Both `chatgpt-shell` and `dall-e-shell` are both based on `shell-maker` and until recently both shared `shell-maker-mode` as their major mode. This didn't play well with yasnippet. Both shells now enable independent major modes: `chatgpt-shell-mode` and `dall-e-shell-mode`. Thank you [Daniel Liden](https://github.com/djliden) for the proposal.

## Saving transcript customizations

Make transcript saving more customizable via `shell-maker-transcript-default-path` and `shell-maker-transcript-default-filename`. Thank you [gnusupport](https://github.com/gnusupport).

## New ChatGPT model versions

New OpenAI model versions were recently released and added to chatgpt-shell: `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613` and `gpt-4-0613`. Thanks you [Norio Suzuki](https://github.com/suzuki).

## Load awesome prompts

`M-x chatgpt-shell-load-awesome-prompts` to download and import curated prompts from [awesome-chatgpt-prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts). Thank you [Daniel Gomez](https://github.com/dangom).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chatgpt-shell-v0601-updates/awesome.png)

## ob-async

We had reports that ob-chatgpt-shell didn't play nice with [ob-async](https://github.com/astahlman/ob-async). Thank you [William Medrano](https://github.com/wmedrano) for the solution.

## Configurable prompts

Functions like `chatgpt-shell-describe-code` ask ChatGPT to describe the code in region. These functions used hardcoded English prompts. These are now configurable, so users can tweak or translate if preferred. Thank you [Norio Suzuki](https://github.com/suzuki).

-   `chatgpt-shell-prompt-header-describe-code`
-   `chatgpt-shell-prompt-header-refactor-code`
-   `chatgpt-shell-prompt-header-generate-unit-test`
-   `chatgpt-shell-prompt-header-proofread-region`
-   `chatgpt-shell-prompt-header-whats-wrong-with-last-command`

# \[2023-07-05 Wed\] Duplicate this!
---
id: duplicate-this

[James Dyer](http://www.dyerdwelling.family/) has a nice [post](https://www.emacs.dyerdwelling.family/emacs/20230606213531-emacs--dired-duplicate-here-revisited/) sharing his frequent [dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html) need to duplicate files. He offers a solution using a custom interactive command. His use-case resonated with me.

Similarly, James' recommendation to bind his file-duplicating command to `C-c d` [^1] sent a signal to my brain triggering [Bozhidar Batsov](https://twitter.com/bbatsov)'s `crux-duplicate-current-line-or-region`.

`crux-duplicate-current-line-or-region` is part of a "collection of Ridiculously useful extensions for Emacs" (yeah that's [crux](https://github.com/bbatsov/crux)). The command itself does what it says on the tin.

Let's duplicate the current line.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/duplicate-this/duplicate-line.gif)

Now let's duplicate the current region.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/duplicate-this/duplicate-region.gif)

Since I already have a well-internalized key-binding duplicating lines/regions in text buffers, I could extend a similar behaviour to dired files with almost zero adoption effort.

In case you haven't noticed, I've made it a [part-time job](https://youtu.be/urcL86UpqZc?t=177) to make command line utilities easily accessible from Emacs ([1](joining-images-from-the-comfort-of-dired/) [2](emacs-dwim-shell-command/) [3](emacs-password-protect-current-pdf-revisited/) [4](dwim-shell-command-now-on-windows/) [5](recordscreenshot-windows-the-lazy-way/) [6](emacs-ffmpeg-and-macos-alias-commands/) [7](emacs-quick-kill-process/) [8](hey-emacs-change-the-default-macos-app-for/) [9](hey-emacs-where-did-i-take-that-photo/) [10](emacs-open-with-macos-app/) [11](emacs-macos-sharing-dwim-style-improved/) [12](emacs-macos-share-from-dired-dwim-style/) [13](emacs-reveal-in-finder-dwim-style/) [14](dwim-shell-command-usages-pdftotext-and-scp/) [15](dwim-shell-command-with-template-prompts/) [16](seamless-command-line-utils/) [17](dwim-shell-command-video-streams/) [18](dwim-shell-command-improvements/) [19](dwim-shell-command-on-melpa/) [20](emacs-dwim-shell-command-multi-language/) [21](png-to-icns-emacs-dwim-style/)) via [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command). Partly because it's fairly quick and partly 'cause it's fun.

Jame's post gave me yet another opportunity to exercise my errrm part-time job. This time, duplicating files. All I need is the [cp](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cp.1.html) utility and a template:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
cp -R '<<f>>' '<<f(u)>>'
```

I seldom type these template's myself when I want to execute a command (via `M-x dwim-shell-command`). I typically wrap these templates in interactive commands, making them easily accessible via `M-x` and your favorite completion framework. I happen to use [ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper).

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(require 'dwim-shell-command)

(defun dwim-shell-commands-duplicate ()
  "Duplicate file(s)."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   "Duplicate file(s)."
   "cp -R '<<f>>' '<<f(u)>>'"
   :utils "cp"))
```

There's nothing much to the command. Most logic is handled by the template, replacing `<<f>>` with the current file and `<<f(u)>>` with a uniquified version of it. Having said this, there's a bunch of free [DWIM](emacs-dwim-do-what-i-mean/) love that kicks in, courtesy of the `dwim-shell-command` package by yours truly. Let's give our new `dwim-shell-commands-duplicate` command a spin.

Like `crux-duplicate-current-line-or-region` duplicates the current line, our new command duplicates the current dired file.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/duplicate-this/duplicate-file.gif)

Got multiple files to duplicate? Like `crux-duplicate-current-line-or-region`, we can use the region for a similar purpose.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/duplicate-this/duplicate-files.gif)

While we have been using the region to duplicate adjacent files, we can also mark specific files.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/duplicate-this/duplicate-marked.gif)

Our `cp -R '<<f>>' '<<f(u)>>'` template uses the `-R` (recursive) flag, so we get another freebie. In addition to files, we can also duplicate directories.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/duplicate-this/duplicate-dirs.gif)

Lastly, because we're on a DWIM train, if your current buffer happens to be visiting a file, you can `M-x dwim-shell-commands-duplicate` the current file to duplicate it. You're automatically dropped to a dired buffer, with point on the new file (à la [dired-jump](https://emacsredux.com/blog/2013/09/24/dired-jump/)).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/duplicate-this/duplicate-buffer.gif)

While duplicating files using a template was a mere `cp -R '<<f>>' '<<f(u)>>'` away, we get a bunch of free DWIM magic applied to a handful of use-cases and contexts. What made the file-duplicating use-case extra special is that it maps almost exactly to an equivalent text command. Keep the same key bindings and we almost get a "[free feature](https://endlessparentheses.com/hungry-delete-mode.html)".

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(use-package crux
  :ensure t
  :commands crux-open-with
  :bind
  (("C-c d" . crux-duplicate-current-line-or-region)))

(use-package dwim-shell-command
  :ensure t
  :bind (:map dired-mode-map
              ("C-c d" . dwim-shell-commands-duplicate))
  :config
  ;; Loads all my own dwim shell commands
  ;; (including `dwim-shell-commands-duplicate')
  (require 'dwim-shell-commands))
```

You can find my ever-growing list of similar commands over at [dwim-shell-commands.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-commands.el) (the optional part of the package). Got some nifty usages? Would love to check 'em out. [Get in touch](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium).

# \[2023-06-29 Thu\] Stitching images from the comfort of dired
---
id: joining-images-from-the-comfort-of-dired
---

I recently wanted a few images stitched together. A perfect job for [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/). A quick search yielded the magical incantation:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
convert image1.jpg image2.jpg image3.jpg +append joined.jpg
```

Great, now I know, but I'll rarely use it and will soon forget it. I may as well add it to my [repository](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-commands.el) of [DWIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM) command line utilities, wrapped in a convenient Emacs function, applicable from different contexts… [know what I mean](emacs-dwim-do-what-i-mean/)? 🙃

I built [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) for this purpose. You can take the above command and easily turn it into an interactive Emacs command with something like the following:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(require 'dwim-shell-command)

(defun dwim-shell-commands-join-images-horizontally ()
  "Join all marked images horizontally as a single image."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   "Join images horizontally"
   "convert -verbose '<<*>>' +append 'joined.jpg'"
   :utils "convert"))
```

You can select as many images as you'd like from the comfort of your dired and *make the ImageMagick happen*.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/joining-images-from-the-comfort-of-dired/burgers.gif)

The snippet does the job just fine, but we can make it smarter. For starters, let's not hardcode the output filename. We'll ask the user instead. While we're asking, let's offer a default filename, but let's not assume the output extension is `.jpg`. Let's guess based on the image selection. While we're at it, let's not override the output file if already exists. Uniquify it.

Most of the above can be achieved by either using [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) helpers or its templating language. For example, `<<joined.png(u)>>` ensures that if `joined.png` already exists, it automatically generates `joined(1).png` instead.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(require 'dwim-shell-command)

(defun dwim-shell-commands-join-images-horizontally ()
  "Join all marked images horizontally as a single image."
  (interactive)
  (let ((filename (format "joined.%s"
                          (or (seq-first (dwim-shell-command--file-extensions)) "png"))))
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "Join images horizontally"
     (format "convert -verbose '<<*>>' +append '<<%s(u)>>'"
             (dwim-shell-command-read-file-name
              (format "Join as image named (default \"%s\"): " filename)
              :default filename))
     :utils "convert")))
```

Here's the new horizontal command in action…

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/joining-images-from-the-comfort-of-dired/burger_row_x1.5_optimized.gif)

Notice how this time we didn't mark the images using `dired-mark`, typically bound to `m`. Instead, we made our selection using the region. Also, if you haven't gotten your junk food fix yet, here's the fries equivalent ;)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/joining-images-from-the-comfort-of-dired/fries_row_x1.5_optimized.gif)

We'll rinse all and repeat to get the vertical command equivalent. I know, I know, there's fair amount of duplication but c'est la vie.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(require 'dwim-shell-command)

(defun dwim-shell-commands-join-images-vertically ()
  "Join all marked images vertically as a single image."
  (interactive)
  (let ((filename (format "joined.%s"
                          (or (seq-first (dwim-shell-command--file-extensions)) "png"))))
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "Join images vertically"
     (format "convert -verbose '<<*>>' -append '<<%s(u)>>'"
             (dwim-shell-command-read-file-name
              (format "Join as image named (default \"%s\"): " filename)
              :default filename))
     :utils "convert")))
```

…and for our grand finale, we'll vertically join our burgers and fries. Behold!

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/joining-images-from-the-comfort-of-dired/finale_x1.5_optimized.gif)

These commands are now part of [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command). To get them, load the optional commands via `(require 'dwim-shell-commands)`.

# \[2023-06-18 Sun\] noweb: the lesser known org babel glue
---
id: noweb-more-glue-for-your-org-toolbox
---

While [Org](https://orgmode.org/) babel's [noweb](https://orgmode.org/manual/Noweb-Reference-Syntax.html) isn't something I've frequently used for literate programming, its simplicity makes it rather versatile to glue all sorts of babel things I hadn't previously considered.

The idea is simple. Add a placeholder like `<<other-block>>` to an [org babel](https://orgmode.org/manual/Working-with-Source-Code.html) source block, and it will be automatically replaced (verbatim) with the content (or result) of referred block before execution. You'll also need the `:noweb yes` header argument.

``` org
#+NAME: other-block
#+begin_src swift
  print("Hello 0")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: other-block
: Hello 0

#+BEGIN_SRC swift :noweb yes
  <<other-block>>
  print("Hello 1")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Hello 0
: Hello 1
```

Since `<<other-block>>` is replaced with the content of said block, at execution time, the block is effectively equivalent to executing:

``` swift
print("Hello 0")
print("Hello 1")
```

Why is this so versatile? Org babel can include/execute all sorts of languages, so you can mix and match the result from one language and massage it to appear as the body of another block using the same (or different) language.

I was recently asked [how to include the result from one babel block in another](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/issues/102) using [ob-chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/#chatgpt-org-babel). While the initial question was looking for a solution involving variables, we can use noweb to achieve a similar goal.

Note that in this case, I'll be using `<<hello()>>`, with `()`, to refer to `#+RESULTS:` rather than the source block itself.

``` org
#+NAME: hello
#+BEGIN_SRC chatgpt-shell
Say hello in spanish
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: hello
Hola

#+BEGIN_SRC chatgpt-shell :noweb yes
<<hello()>>
What does the previous line say verbatim?
#+END_SRC
```

Executing the block

``` {.chatgpt-shell noweb="yes"}
<<hello()>>
What does the previous line say verbatim?
```

Gives us

```{=org}
#+RESULTS:
```
``` example
The previous line says "Hola".
```

On a similar note, I was asked if the results from a previous source block could be [fed to a Swift Chart block](https://indieweb.social/@kickingvegas@sfba.social/110562099134297469) using [ob-swiftui](https://github.com/xenodium/ob-swiftui).

While I'm new to [Swift Charts](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Charts), I do love glueing things via Emacs lisp. I figured I could write a little elisp to generate random data and feed it to a SwiftUI block via `<<data()>>`. The result is pretty neat, based on Apple's [LineMark example](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts/linemark).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/noweb-more-glue-for-your-org-toolbox/data-chart.gif)

``` org
#+NAME: data
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (concat (mapconcat (lambda (n)
                       (format "MonthlyHoursOfSunshine(city: \"Seattle\", month: %d, hoursOfSunshine: %d),"
                               n (random 100)))
                     (number-sequence 1 20) "\n")
          "\n"
          (mapconcat (lambda (n)
                       (format "MonthlyHoursOfSunshine(city: \"Cupertino\", month: %d, hoursOfSunshine: %d),"
                               n (random 100)))
                     (number-sequence 1 20) "\n"))
#+end_src

#+begin_src swiftui :results file :noweb yes
  import Charts

  struct MonthlyHoursOfSunshine: Identifiable {
    var city: String
    var date: Date
    var hoursOfSunshine: Double
    var id = UUID()

    init(city: String, month: Int, hoursOfSunshine: Double) {
      let calendar = Calendar.autoupdatingCurrent
      self.city = city
      self.date = calendar.date(from: DateComponents(year: 2020, month: month))!
      self.hoursOfSunshine = hoursOfSunshine
    }
  }

  struct ContentView: View {
    var data: [MonthlyHoursOfSunshine] = [
<<data()>>
    ]
    var body: some View {
      Chart(data) {
        LineMark(
          x: .value("Month", $0.date),
          y: .value("Hours of Sunshine", $0.hoursOfSunshine)
        )
        .foregroundStyle(by: .value("City", $0.city))
      }
      .frame(minWidth: 800, minHeight: 300)
      .padding()
      .colorScheme(.dark)
    }
  }
#+end_src
```

While I've shown fairly basic usages of noweb, we can accomplish some nifty integrations. Check out the [noweb reference syntax](https://orgmode.org/manual/Noweb-Reference-Syntax.html) for more examples and additional header arguments like `tangle`, `strip-tangle`, and others.

# \[2023-05-25 Thu\] Deleting from Emacs sequence vars
---
id: deleting-from-emacs-sequence-vars
---

Adding hooks and setting variables is core to customizing Emacs. Take a major mode like `emacs-lisp-mode` as an example. To customize its behaviour, one may add a hook function to `emacs-lisp-mode-hook`, or if you're a little lazy while experimenting, you may even use a lambda.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook
          #'my/emacs-lisp-mode-config)

(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (message "I woz ere")))
```

`emacs-lisp-mode-hook`'s content would subsequently look as follows:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
'(my/emacs-lisp-mode-config
  (lambda nil
    (message "I woz ere"))
  ert--activate-font-lock-keywords
  easy-escape-minor-mode
  lisp-extra-font-lock-global-mode)
```

Maybe `my/emacs-lisp-mode-config` didn't work out for us and we'd like to remove it. We can use `remove-hook` for that and evaluate something like:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(remove-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook #'my/emacs-lisp-mode-config)
```

The lambda can be removed too, but you ought to be careful in using the same lambda body.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(remove-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook
             (lambda ()
               (message "I woz tere")))
```

There are other ways to remove the lambdas, but we're digressing here… We typically have to write these throwaway snippets to undo our experiments. What if we just had a handy helper always available to remove items from sequences *(edit: we do, `remove-hook` is already interactive, see Update 2 below)*? After all, hooks are just lists (sequences).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/deleting-from-emacs-sequence-vars/removed-lambda.gif)

While the interactive command can likely be simplified further, I tried to optimize for ergonomic usage. For example, `completing-read` gives us a way narrow down whichever variable we'd like to modify as well as the item we'd like to remove. `seqp` is also handy, as we filter out noise by automatically removing any variable that's not a sequence.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun ar/remove-from-list-variable ()
  (interactive)
  (let* ((var (intern
               (completing-read "From variable: "
                                (let (symbols)
                                  (mapatoms
                                   (lambda (sym)
                                     (when (and (boundp sym)
                                                (seqp (symbol-value sym)))
                                       (push sym symbols))))
                                  symbols) nil t)))
         (values (mapcar (lambda (item)
                           (setq item (prin1-to-string item))
                           (concat (truncate-string-to-width
                                    (nth 0 (split-string item "\n"))
                                    (window-body-width))
                                   (propertize item 'invisible t)))
                         (symbol-value var)))
         (index (progn
                  (when (seq-empty-p values) (error "Already empty"))
                  (seq-position values (completing-read "Delete: " values nil t)))))

    (set var (append (seq-take (symbol-value var) index)
                     (seq-drop (symbol-value var) (1+ index))))
    (message "Deleted: %s" (truncate-string-to-width
                            (seq-elt values index)
                            (- (window-body-width) 9)))))
```

Hooks are just an example of lists we can delete from. I recently used the same command on `display-buffer-alist`.

While this has been a fun exercise, I can't help but think that I'm likely re-inventing the wheel here. Is there something already built-in that I'm missing?

## Update 1

[alphapapa](https://www.reddit.com/user/github-alphapapa/) suggested some generalizations that would provide [an editing buffer of sorts](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/13rvehx/comment/jlni3fc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). This is a neat idea, using familiar key bindigs `C-c C-c` to save and `C-c C-k` to bail.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/deleting-from-emacs-sequence-vars/edit.gif)

Beware, I haven't tested the code with a diverse set of list items, so there's a chance of corrupting the variable content. Improvements to the code are totally welcome.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}

                                  (mapatoms
                                   (lambda (sym)
                                     (when (and (boundp sym)

                                       (push sym symbols))))
                                  symbols) nil t)))
         (values (string-join
                  (mapcar #'prin1-to-string (symbol-value var))
                  "\n")))
    (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create "*eval elisp*")
      (emacs-lisp-mode)
      (local-set-key (kbd "C-c C-c")
                     (lambda ()
                       (interactive)
                       (eval-buffer)
                       (kill-this-buffer)
                       (message "Saved: %s" var)))
      (local-set-key (kbd "C-c C-k") 'kill-this-buffer)
      (erase-buffer)
      (insert (format "(setq %s\n `(%s))" var values))
      (mark-whole-buffer)
      (indent-region (point-min) (point-max))
      (deactivate-mark)
      (switch-to-buffer (current-buffer)))))
```

So hunch was right…

# \[2023-05-18 Thu\] Sprinkle me logs
---
id: sprinkle-me-logs

At times, basic prints/logs are just about the right debugging strategy. Sure, we have debuggers and [REPLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) which are super useful, but sometimes you just know that sprinkling your code with a handful of temporary prints/logs will get you enough info to fix an issue.

I must confess, my temporary print statements are fairly uninspiring. Sometimes I log the name of the method/function, but I also resort to less creative options like `print("Yay")` or `print("Got here")`.

My laziness and lack of creativity knows no boundaries, so if I need multiple unique entries, I often copy, paste, and append numbers to my entries: `print("Yay 2")`, `print("Yay 3")`, `print("Yay 4")`… I know, are you judging yet?

So rather than develop the creative muscle, I've decided to lean on laziness and old habits, so let's make old habit more efficient :) I no longer want to copy, paste, and increment my uncreative log statements. Instead, I'll let Emacs do it for me!

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/sprinkle-me-logs/log-elisp.gif)

There isn't a whole lot to the implementation. It searches the current buffer for other instances of the same logging string and captures the largest counter found. It subsequently prints the same string with the counter incremented. This can be done in a few lines of elisp, but I figure I wanted some additional features like auto indenting and changing the logging string when using a prefix.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defvar ar/unique-log-word "Yay")

(defun ar/insert-unique-log-word (prefix)
  "Inserts `ar/unique-log-word' incrementing counter.

With PREFIX, change `ar/unique-log-word'."
  (interactive "P")
  (let* ((word (cond (prefix
                      (setq ar/unique-log-word
                            (read-string "Log word: ")))

                            (buffer-substring (region-beginning)
                                              (region-end))))

Note: This snippet may evolve independently of this post. For the latest, chech my [Emacs config](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies)'s [fe-prog.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/features/fe-prog.el).

I want to be lazy in other languages, so the function can now be extended to support other languages. Here's the Swift counterpart.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/sprinkle-me-logs/log-swift.gif)

Since I sometimes log function names, I figured making it region-aware would help with that.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/sprinkle-me-logs/log-selection.gif)

I'm sure there's a package out there that does something similar, but I figure this would be a fun little elisp hack.

Happy logging!

## Update 1

Set `ar/unique-log-word` to nil and let it generate a random word. Maybe I get to learn new words as I debug ;)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/sprinkle-me-logs/word.gif)

## Update 2

Added Ada and C++ support, thanks to [James Dyer's post](https://www.emacs.dyerdwelling.family/emacs/20230523204523-emacs--insert-unique-log-message/).

# \[2023-05-11 Thu\] dwim-shell-command on Windows + upload to 0x0.st

You can now use [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) on Windows. Shoutout to Kartik Saranathan, who sent a [pull request](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/pull/9) to get rid of `ls` usage.

Also thanks to Bram for sharing his [upload to 0x0.st implementation](https://indieweb.social/@bram85@emacs.ch/110335134760990713). I'd been wanting to do something similar for [imgur](https://imgur.com/), but [0x0.st](https://0x0.st/) is a much better alternative!

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/dwim-shell-command-now-on-windows/0x0.gif)

`dwim-shell-commands-upload-to-0x0` is now part of [dwim-shell-commands.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/commit/1a896221cc34319582b0921b919638ea2528b0e6) (the optional part of the package). It has a couple of additional touches:

-   Open the uploaded image in [eww](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/EWW.html) browser.
-   Automatically copy the upload URL to kill-ring. You're likely gonna share this link, right?

If you're unfamiliar with `dwim-shell-command`, it enables Emacs shell commands with DWIM behaviour:

-   Asynchronously.
-   Using noweb templates.
-   Automatically injecting files (from [dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html) or other buffers) or kill ring.
-   Managing buffer focus with heuristics.
-   Showing progress bar.
-   Quick buffer exit.
-   More reusable history.

In addition to replacing `shell-command` with `dwim-shell-command`, I also use it to bring all sorts of command line utilities to familiar Emacs workflows (in dired or current buffers), without having to remember complex command invocations.

I've covered many of the use-cases before:

In [chatgpt-shell updates](chatgpt-shell-available-on-melpa/), I highlighted `dall-e-shell` (a DALL-E Emacs shell), `ob-chatgpt-shell` (ChatGPT org babel support), and `ob-dall-e-shell` (DALL-E org babel support) were initially excluded from the [chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell) MELPA submission while I worked out their split.

That's now sorted and the packages are available on MELPA.

# \[2023-04-28 Fri\] Generating elisp org docs
---
id: generating-elisp-org-docs
---

[chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell)'s README includes few org tables documenting the package's [customizable variables](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell#chatgpt-shell-customizations) as well as [available commands](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell#chatgpt-shell-commands). Don't worry, this isn't really another ChatGPT post.

Here's an extract of the docs table:

``` {.org lexical="no"}
| Custom variable                       | Description                                                 |
|---------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------|
| chatgpt-shell-display-function        | Function to display the shell.                              |
| chatgpt-shell-curl-additional-options | Additional options for `curl' command.                      |
| chatgpt-shell-system-prompt           | The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. |
```

While the table docs didn't take long to build manually, they quickly became out of sync with their elisp counterparts. Not ideal, as it'll require a little more careful maintenance in the future.

Emacs being the self-documenting editor that it is, I figured I should be able to extract customizable variables, commands, along with their respective docs, and generate these very same org tables.

I had no idea how to go about this, but [apropos-variable](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Apropos.html) and [apropos-command](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Apropos.html) surely knew where to fetch the details from. A peek into `apropos.el` quickly got me on my way. Turns out [mapatoms](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Creating-Symbols.html#Definition-of-mapatoms) is just what I needed. It iterates over [obarray](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Creating-Symbols.html), Emacs's symbol table. We can use it to extract the symbols we're after.

Since we're filtering symbols from `chatgpt-shell`, we can start by including only those whose `symbol-name` match "\^chatgpt-shell". Out of all matching, we should only keep custom variables. We can use `custom-variable-p` to check for that. This gives us all relevant variables. We can subsequently get each variable's corresponding docs using `(get symbol 'variable-documentation)` and put it into a list.

Now, if we pull our org babel rabbit out of our Emacs magic hat, we can use `:results table` to print the list as an org table. The source block powering this magic trick looks as follows:

``` org
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results table :colnames '("Custom variable" "Description")
  (let ((rows))
    (mapatoms
     (lambda (symbol)
       (when (and (string-match "^chatgpt-shell"
                                (symbol-name symbol))
                  (custom-variable-p symbol))
         (push `(,symbol
                 ,(car
                   (split-string
                    (or (get (indirect-variable symbol)
                             'variable-documentation)
                        (get symbol 'variable-documentation)
                        "")
                    "\n")))
               rows))))
    rows)
#+end_src
```

And just like that… we effortlessly get our elisp docs in an org table, straight from Emacs's symbol table.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/generating-elisp-org-docs/docs.gif)

It's worth noting that our snippet used `indirect-variable` to resolve aliases but also limited descriptions to the first line in each docstring.

To build a similar table for interactive commands, we can use the following block (also including bindings).

``` org
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results table :colnames '("Binding" "Command" "Description")
  (let ((rows))
    (mapatoms
     (lambda (symbol)
       (when (and (string-match "^chatgpt-shell"
                                (symbol-name symbol))
                  (commandp symbol))
         (push `(,(mapconcat
                   #'help--key-description-fontified
                   (where-is-internal
                    symbol shell-maker-mode-map nil nil (command-remapping symbol)) ", ")
                 ,symbol
                 ,(car
                   (split-string
                    (or (documentation symbol t) "")
                    "\n")))
               rows))))
    rows)
#+END_SRC
```

About a month ago, I posted about an experiment to build [a ChatGPT Emacs shell](a-chatgpt-emacs-shell/) using [comint mode](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shell-Prompts.html). Since then, it's turned into a package of sorts, evolving with [user feedback](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+) and [pull requests](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed).

## Now on MELPA

While [chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell) is a young package still, it seems useful enough to share more widely. As of today, `chatgpt-shell` is [available on MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/chatgpt-shell). Many thanks to [Chris Rayner](https://github.com/riscy) for his MELPA guidance to get the package added.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chatgpt-shell-available-on-melpa/cyberpunk.gif)

I'll cover some of the goodies included in the latest `chatgpt-shell`.

## Delegating to Org Babel

`chatgpt-shell` now evaluates Markdown source blocks by delegating to [org babel](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/). I've had success with a handful of languages. In some instances, some babel headers may need overriding in `chatgpt-shell-babel-headers`.

Here's a Swift execution via babel, showing standard output.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chatgpt-shell-available-on-melpa/swift.gif)

In addition to standard output, `chatgpt-shell` can now render blocks generating images. Here's a rendered SwiftUI layout via [ob-swiftui](https://github.com/xenodium/ob-swiftui).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chatgpt-shell-available-on-melpa/swiftui.gif)

Can also do diagrams. Here's [ditaa](https://ditaa.sourceforge.net/) in action.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chatgpt-shell-available-on-melpa/ditaa.gif)

## Renaming blocks

At times, ChatGPT may forget to label source blocks or maybe you just want to name it differently… You can now rename blocks at point.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chatgpt-shell-available-on-melpa/rename.gif)

## Send prompt/region

There are a handful of commands to send prompts from other buffers, including the region. For example `chatgpt-shell-explain-code`.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chatgpt-shell-available-on-melpa/explain-region.gif)

-   chatgpt-shell-send-region
-   chatgpt-shell-generate-unit-test
-   chatgpt-shell-refactor-code
-   chatgpt-shell-proofread-doc
-   chatgpt-shell-eshell-summarize-last-command-output
-   chatgpt-shell-eshell-whats-wrong-with-last-command

## Saving/restoring transcript

You can save your current session to a transcript and restore later.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chatgpt-shell-available-on-melpa/restore.gif)

## History improvements

[Nicolas Martyanoff](https://www.n16f.net/) has a great post on [making IELM More Comfortable](https://www.n16f.net/blog/making-ielm-more-comfortable/). A couple of improvements that stood out for me were:

-   Making the command history persistent.
-   Searching history with `shell-maker-search-history` / `M-r` via `completing-read`.

`shell-maker-search-history`, coupled with your completion framework of choice, can be pretty handy. I happen to use Oleh Krehel's [ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper).

## shell-maker (make your own AI shells)

While ChatGPT is a popular service, there are many others sprouting. Some are cloud-based, others local, proprietary, open source… In any case, it'd be great be able to hook on to them without much overhead. [shell-maker](a-shell-maker/) should help with that. The first `shell-maker` clients are `chatgpt-shell` and `dall-e-shell`.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chatgpt-shell-available-on-melpa/dalle.png)

While I've built `dall-e-shell`, it'd be great to see what others can do with `shell-maker`. If you wire it up to anything, please get in touch ([Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xenodium) / [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/xenodium) / [Email](mailto:me__AT__xenodium.com)).

## dall-e-shell, ob-chatgpt-shell, and ob-dall-e-shell (on MELPA too)

UPDATE: [dall-e-shell](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium/110087011082546281), [ob-chatgpt-shell](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium/110130580337078002), and [ob-dall-e-shell](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium/110142796865197004) are now available on MELPA also.

You've seen `dall-e-shell` in the previous section. Here's what `ob-chatgpt-shell` and `ob-dall-e-shell` look like in an [org mode](https://orgmode.org/) document:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chatgpt-shell-available-on-melpa/babel.png)

## How are you using `chatgpt-shell`?

Whether you are an existing `chatgpt-shell` user, or would like to give things a try, [installing from MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/chatgpt-shell) should generally make things easier for ya. As I mentioned, `chatgpt-shell` is a young package still. There are unexplored Emacs integrations out there. I'd love to hear about whatever you come up with ([Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium) / [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xenodium) / [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/xenodium) / [Email](mailto:me__AT__xenodium.com)).

# \[2023-04-22 Sat\] Recording and screenshotting windows: the lazy way
---
id: recordscreenshot-windows-the-lazy-way
---

While there's no substitution for great written documentation, a quick demo can go a long way in conveying what a tool if capable of doing or what a tip/trick can achieve.

If you've read a handful of my posts, you would have come across either a screenshot or a short clip with some demo. Historically, I've used the macOS's built-in utility invoked via `⌘ + Shift + 5`. It does a fine job for screenshots. For video captures, it's got a couple of small quirks.

## Record window

Unlike screenshots, macOS video capture cannot record a specific window. While you can select a region, it's easy to inadvertently include a portion of your wallpaper in the recording. Not a big deal, but I felt posted screencasts could look as clean as their screenshot counterparts if we could record the window alone.

Let's compare grabbing a region vs window alone. I know the clean look may be subjective, but see what I mean?

<figure width="50%">
<img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/recordscreenshot-windows-the-lazy-way/record-bg.gif" />
<figcaption>Capture region (includes wallpaper/background)</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure width="50%">
<img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/recordscreenshot-windows-the-lazy-way/record.gif" />
<figcaption>Capture window only (ahhh, so clean)</figcaption>
</figure>

## Cancel recording

macOS has a handy shortcut (`⌘ + Ctrl + Esc`) to stop recording. If you got your demo right, you're done. If not, you have one more step remaining (right click to delete the blooper).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/recordscreenshot-windows-the-lazy-way/delete.png)

Also not a huge deal, but I was hoping for a single shortcut to stop recording [and]{.underline} also automatically discard. I haven't found one, but would love to hear if otherwise.

## macosrec enters the chat

I wanted more flexibility to build my own recording/screenshotting flows. A command line utility could be quite versatile at that, so I built [macosrec](https://github.com/xenodium/macosrec).

`macosrec` enables taking a screenshot or recording a window video entirely from the command line.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/recordscreenshot-windows-the-lazy-way/macosrec.gif)

## elisp glues the world

Command line utilities can be invoked in all sorts of ways, but I'm an Emacs nutter so you can see where this is going… I want Emacs key bindings to control the lot.

  -------- -----------------------------
  C-c \_   Take screenshot of a window
  C-c (    Start recording window
  C-c )    Stop recording window
  C-c 8    Abort recording
  -------- -----------------------------

Integrating command line utilities into Emacs and making them quickly accessible seems to have become a full-time hobby of mine. I kid, but it's become a pretty painless process for me. I built [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) for that. If you've never heard of [DWIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM), it stands for "Do what I mean". To give you an idea of the kinds of things I'm using DWIM commands for, check the following out:

-   dwim-shell-commands-audio-to-mp3
-   dwim-shell-commands-bin-plist-to-xml
-   dwim-shell-commands-clipboard-to-qr
-   dwim-shell-commands-drop-video-audio
-   dwim-shell-commands-files-combined-size
-   dwim-shell-commands-git-clone-clipboard-url
-   dwim-shell-commands-git-clone-clipboard-url-to-downloads
-   dwim-shell-commands-image-to-grayscale
-   dwim-shell-commands-image-to-icns
-   dwim-shell-commands-image-to-jpg
-   dwim-shell-commands-image-to-png
-   dwim-shell-commands-pdf-password-protect
-   dwim-shell-commands-reorient-image
-   dwim-shell-commands-resize-gif
-   dwim-shell-commands-resize-image
-   dwim-shell-commands-resize-video
-   dwim-shell-commands-speed-up-gif
-   dwim-shell-commands-speed-up-video
-   dwim-shell-commands-unzip
-   dwim-shell-commands-video-to-gif
-   dwim-shell-commands-video-to-optimized-gif
-   dwim-shell-commands-video-to-webp

If it ever took you a little while to find the right command incantation to get things right, only to forget all about it next time you need it ([I'm looking at you ffmpeg](emacs-ffmpeg-and-macos-alias-commands)), `dwim-shell-command` can help you easily save things for posterity and make them easily accessible in the future.

Since we're talking ffmpeg, here's all it takes to have gif conversion handy:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-commands-video-to-gif ()
  "Convert all marked videos to gif(s)."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   "Convert to gif"
   "ffmpeg -loglevel quiet -stats -y -i '<<f>>' -pix_fmt rgb24 -r 15 '<<fne>>.gif'"
   :utils "ffmpeg"))
```

There's no way I'll remember the ffmpeg command, but I can always fuzzy search my trusty commands with something like `"to gif"` and apply to either the current buffer file or any selected [dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html) files.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/recordscreenshot-windows-the-lazy-way/to-gif.png)

So where am I going with this? I wrote DWIM shell commands for the bindings I previously described:

  -------- ----------------------------------------------------
  C-c \_   `dwim-shell-commands-macos-screenshot-window`
  C-c (    `dwim-shell-commands-macos-start-recording-window`
  C-c )    `dwim-shell-commands-macos-end-recording-window`
  C-c 8    `dwim-shell-commands-macos-abort-recording-window`
  -------- ----------------------------------------------------

Out of all of commands, `dwim-shell-commands-macos-start-recording-window` is likely the most interesting one.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-commands-macos-start-recording-window ()
  "Select and start recording a macOS window."
  (interactive)
  (let* ((window (dwim-shell-commands--macos-select-window))
         (path (dwim-shell-commands--generate-path "~/Desktop" (car window) ".mov"))
         (buffer-file-name path) ;; override so <<f>> picks it up
         (inhibit-message t))
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
       "Start recording a macOS window."
       (format
        "# record .mov
         macosrec --record '%s' --mov --output '<<f>>'
         # speed .mov up x1.5
         ffmpeg -i '<<f>>' -an -filter:v 'setpts=1.5*PTS' '<<fne>>_x1.5.<<e>>'
         # convert to gif x1.5
         ffmpeg -loglevel quiet -stats -y -i '<<fne>>_x1.5.<<e>>' -pix_fmt rgb24 -r 15 '<<fne>>_x1.5.gif'
         # speed .mov up x2
         ffmpeg -i '<<f>>' -an -filter:v 'setpts=2*PTS' '<<fne>>_x2.<<e>>'
         # convert to gif x2
         ffmpeg -loglevel quiet -stats -y -i '<<fne>>_x2.<<e>>' -pix_fmt rgb24 -r 15 '<<fne>>_x2.gif'"
        (cdr window))
       :silent-success t
       :monitor-directory "~/Desktop"
       :no-progress t
       :utils '("ffmpeg" "macosrec"))))
```

As you likely expect, this command invokes `macosrec` to start recording a window. The nifty part is that when it's done recording (and saving the .mov file), it automatically creates multiple variants. For starters, it creates x1.5 and x2 .mov videos, but it also generates their .gif counterparts.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/recordscreenshot-windows-the-lazy-way/bunch.png)

Let's recap here for a sec. You start recording a window video with `C-c (`, end with `C-c )`, and automagically have all these generated files waiting for you.

You can subsequently inspect any of the video candidates and pick the most appropriate variant. Discard whatever else you don't need.

The output bundle is tailored to my needs. Maybe you want to invoke [gifsycle](https://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/) for more optimized versions? Or maybe you want automatic webp generation via `ffmpeg`? DWIM does that I mean, so you likely have other plans…

`dwim-shell-commands-macos-start-recording-window` and all other DWIM commands are now included in [dwim-shell-commands.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-commands.el), which ships optionally as part of [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command).

[macosrec](https://github.com/xenodium/macosrec) is also on GitHub, but if you want to be on your way, you can install via:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew tap xenodium/macosrec
brew install macosrec
```

This is my way to record and screenshot windows the lazy way. How would you tweak to make it yours?

# \[2023-04-20 Thu\] ob-swiftui updates
---
id: ob-swiftui-updates
---

While [experimenting with delegating Markdown](https://indieweb.social/@xenodium/110227186721704189) blocks to [Org babel](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/) in Emacs [chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell), I resurrected [ob-swiftui](https://github.com/xenodium/ob-swiftui). A package I had written to execute and render SwiftUI blocks in org babel.

[ob-swiftui](https://github.com/xenodium/ob-swiftui) has two modes of rendering SwiftUI blocks: `:results window`, which runs outside of Emacs in a native window and `:results file`, which renders and saves to a file. The latter can be viewed directly from Emacs.

`:results file` was a little clunky. That is, it hardcoded dimensions I had to manually modify if the canvas wasn't big enough. It was also a little slow.

The clunkyness really came through with my chatgpt-shell experiments, so I took a closer look and made a few changes to remove hardcoding and speeds things up.

The results ain't too shabby.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/ob-swiftui-updates/file-render.gif)

Another tiny improvement is that if you'd like to compose a more complex layout made of multiple custom views, `ob-swiftui` now looks for a `ContentView` as that root view by default. Specifying another root view was already possible but it had to be explicitly requested via `:view` param.

You can now omit the `:view` param if you name the root view `ContentView`:

``` org
#+begin_src swiftui
  struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        TopView()
        BottomView()
    }
  }

  struct TopView: View {
    var body: some View {
      Text("Top text")
    }
  }

  struct BottomView: View {
    var body: some View {
      Text("Bottom text")
    }
  }
#+end_src
```

The improvements have been pushed to [ob-swiftui](https://github.com/xenodium/ob-swiftui) and will soon be picked up on [melpa](https://melpa.org/#/ob-swiftui).

Edit: Added ContentView details.

# \[2023-04-15 Sat\] My Emacs eye candy
---
id: my-emacs-eye-candy
---

I get the occasional question about my Emacs theme, font, and other eye candy. I'm always tickled and happy to share.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/my-emacs-eye-candy/Emacs.png)

It's been a while since I've made visually significant changes to my Emacs config. May as well briefly document for posterity…

## Nyan Mode

First things first. The adorable and colorful little fella in my mode line is a [Nyan Cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyan_Cat) (if you dare, check the [meme video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2-TGUlwu4)). Yes, I know it's sooo 2011, but it's 2023 and I still love the little guy hanging out in my Emacs mode line. I still get asked about it.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/my-emacs-eye-candy/Nyan.png)

This fabulous feature comes to us via the great [Nyan Mode](https://github.com/TeMPOraL/nyan-mode/) package. If looks haven't convinced you, Nyan also packs scrolling functionality. Click anywhere in it.

Oh, and if you can't get enough of Nyan, there's also [zone-nyan](https://depp.brause.cc/zone-nyan/) for Emacs.

## Emacs Plus (macOS)

I should mention I'm running Emacs 28 on macOS via the excellent [Emacs Plus](https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus) [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) recipe. These are all the options I enable.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install  emacs-plus@28 --with-imagemagick --with-no-frame-refocus --with-native-comp --with-savchenkovaleriy-big-sur-icon
```

### Icon

Since we're talking eye candy, let's chat about `--with-savchenkovaleriy-big-sur-icon`. This Emacs Plus option enables Valeriy Savchenko's [wonderful icon](https://github.com/SavchenkoValeriy/emacs-icons).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/my-emacs-eye-candy/swap.png)

### Titlebar

I've enabled both transparent title bar as well as dark appearance, giving a minimal window decoration.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/my-emacs-eye-candy/decoration.jpg)

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-transparent-titlebar . t))
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-appearance . dark))
```

Note: both of these variables are prefixed `ns-` (macOS-only settings).

## Font (JetBrains Mono)

I've been on [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) font for quite some time now. In the past, I've also been a fan of [Mononoki](https://madmalik.github.io/mononoki/) and [Menlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_(typeface)) (on macOS) or [Meslo](https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font) (similar elsewhere).

## Theme (Material)

I'm using the great [Material Theme for Emacs](https://github.com/cpaulik/emacs-material-theme), with a [bunch of tweaks of my own](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/790465b1824481b81bf5c6e08949128c13d76f95/emacs/features/fe-ui.el#L42).

## Modeline tabs/ribbons (Moody)

The [moody](https://github.com/tarsius/moody) package adds a nice touch displaying mode line elements as tabs and ribbons.

## Modeline menus (Minions)

The [minions](https://github.com/tarsius/minions) package removes lots of minor mode clutter from the mode line and stashes it away in menus.

## Hiding modeline (hide mode line mode)

Hiding the mode line isn't something I use in most major modes. However, I found it complements my shell ([eshell](https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/complete-guide-mastering-eshell)) quite well. While I was sceptical at first, once I hid the mode line in my shell I never looked back. I just didn't miss it. I also love the uncluttered clean vibe. [hide-mode-line-mode](https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-hide-mode-line) can help with that.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/my-emacs-eye-candy/eshell.gif)

## Welcome screen

Back in October 2022, I experimented with [adding a minimal welcome screen](emacs-a-welcoming-experiment/). I was initially hesitant, as I was already a fan of the welcome scratch buffer. In any case, I figured I'd eventually get tired of it and remove it. Well, it's enabled in my config still ;) My initial attachment to a landing scratch quickly faded. I'm only a `C-x b` binding away from invoking ivy-switch-buffer to get me anywhere.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/my-emacs-eye-candy/welcome.png)

The great Emacs logo originally [shared by u/pearcidar43](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/yamj5f/exwm_emacs_is_kinda_comfy_as_a_wm/).

## Zones

I've been meaning to re-enable [zones](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/play/zone.el) in my config. They always gave me a good tickle. I've already mentioned [zone-nyan](https://depp.brause.cc/zone-nyan/), but if you're new to zones, they kick off after a period of inactivity (similar to a screensaver).

Here's `zone-pgm-rotate` in all its glory. Oh and it's built-in!

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/my-emacs-eye-candy/rotate.webp)

Coincidentally, I had a go at writing [a basic zone a little while ago](emacs-zones-to-lift-you-up/).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/my-emacs-eye-candy/zone.gif)

## Config

Most of the items mentioned I pulled from my [Emacs config](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies)'s [fe-ui.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/features/fe-ui.el). There's more there if you're interested.

# \[2023-04-08 Sat\] shell-maker, a maker of Emacs shells
---
id: a-shell-maker
---

A few weeks ago, I wrote about an experiment to bring [ChatGPT to Emacs as a shell](a-chatgpt-emacs-shell/). I was fairly new to both [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) and building anything on top of [comint](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shell-Prompts.html). It was a fun exercise, which also generated some interest.

As mentioned in the previous post, I took inspiration in other Emacs packages (primarily [ielm](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Lisp-Interaction.html)) to figure out what I needed from comint. Soon, I got ChatGPT working.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-shell-maker/streamer.gif)

As I was looking at [OpenAI](https://openai.com) API docs, I learned about DALL-E: "an AI system that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language."

Like ChatGPT, they also offered an API to DALL-E, so I figured I may as well try to write a shell for that too… and I did.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-shell-maker/dalle.gif)

There was quite a bit of code duplication between the two Emacs shells I had just written. At the same time, I started hearing from folks about integrating other tools, some cloud-based, some local, proprietary, open source.. There's [Cody](https://about.sourcegraph.com/cody), [invoke-ai](https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI), [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), [alpaca.cpp](https://github.com/antimatter15/alpaca.cpp), and the list continues to grow.

With that in mind, I set out to reduce the code duplication and consolidate into a reusable package. And so `shell-maker` was born, a maker of Emacs shells.

`shell-maker`'s internals aren't too different from the code I had before. It's still powered by comint, but instead offers a reusable convenience wrapper.

It takes little code to implement a shell, like the sophisticated new `greeter-shell` ;)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-shell-maker/maria.gif)

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(require 'shell-maker)

(defvar greeter-shell--config
  (make-shell-maker-config
   :name "Greeter"
   :execute-command
   (lambda (command _history callback error-callback)
     (funcall callback
              (format "Hello \"%s\"" command)
              nil))))

(defun greeter-shell ()
  "Start a Greeter shell."
  (interactive)
  (shell-maker-start greeter-shell--config))
```

[shell-maker](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell#shell-maker) is available on GitHub and currently bundled with [chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell). If there's enough interest and usage, I may just break it out into its own package. For now, it's convenient to keep with `chatgpt-shell` and `dall-e-shell`.

If you plug `shell-maker` into other tools, I'd love to hear about it.

Happy shell making!

# \[2023-03-21 Tue\] A ChatGPT Emacs shell
---
id: a-chatgpt-emacs-shell
---

UPDATE: `chatgpt-shell` [has evolved a bit](chatgpt-shell-available-on-melpa/) and is now [on MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/chatgpt-shell).

I had been meaning to give [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) a good try, preferably from Emacs. As an [eshell](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html) fan, ChatGPT seemed like the perfect fit for a shell interface of sorts. With that in mind, I set out to wire ChatGPT with Emacs's general command interpreter ([comint](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shell-Prompts.html)).

I had no previous experience building anything comint-related, so I figured I could just take a peek at an existing comint-derived mode to achieve a similar purpose. `inferior-emacs-lisp-mode` ([ielm](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Lisp-Interaction.html)) seemed to fit the bill just fine, so I borrowed quite a bit to assemble a basic shell experience.

From then on, it was mostly about sending each request over to the ChatGPT API to get a response. For now, I'm relying on [curl](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html) to make each request. The invocation is fairly straightforward:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
curl "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{
     \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",
     \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"YOUR PROMPT\"}]
     }"
```

There are two bits of information needed in each request. The API key, which you must get from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), and the prompt text itself (i.e. whatever you want ChatGPT to help you with). The results are not too shabby.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-chatgpt-emacs-shell/chatgpt.gif)

I've uploaded the code to GitHub as a tiny [chatgpt-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell) package. It's a little experimental and rough still, but hey, it does the job for now. Head over to [github](https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell) to take a look. The latest iteration handles multiline prompts (use C-j for newlines) and basic code highlighting.

Let's see where it all goes. Pull requests for improvements totally welcome ;-)

# \[2023-03-04 Sat\] `*scratch*` a new minimal org mode scratch area for iOS
---
id: scratch-a-minimal-scratch-area
---

While we already have lots of note-taking apps on iOS, I wanted a minimal `*scratch*` area (à la Emacs), so I built one.

    <img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/scratch-a-minimal-scratch-area/icon.png" alt="*scratch* icon" width="150px">
  </a>
</center>

What's the use-case? You're on the go. Someone's telling you directions, or a phone number, name of a restaurant, anything really… you just need to write it down *right now, quickly*!

No time to create a new contact, a note, a file, or spend time on additional taps, bring up keyboard… You just want to write it somewhere with the least amount of friction.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/scratch-a-minimal-scratch-area/scratch-download_no_audio_x2.6.webp)

Being an Emacs and org user, I had to sprinkle the app with basic markup support for headings, lists and checkboxes. Also, having a `*scratch*` "buffer" on my iPhone gives me that warm emacsy fuzzy feeling :)

You can download `*scratch*` from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/scratch/id1671420139).

Find it useful? Please help me spread the word. Tell your friends.

# \[2023-01-29 Sun\] Chicken Karaage recipe

id: chicken-karaage-recipe

Huge fan of Chicken Karaage, but never really made it at home until recently.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chicken-karaage-recipe/frying.jpg)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chicken-karaage-recipe/dipping.jpg)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chicken-karaage-recipe/sauces.jpg)

## Dice the chicken

-   350 grams boneless chicken thighs

Dice the chicken up.

## Marinade for 30 mins

-   1 tablespoon soy sauce (Kikkoman or similar)
-   1 tablespoon cooking Sake
-   2 tablespoons of grated ginger (include liquids)
-   1/2 teaspoon Mirin

Mix all ingredients into a ziploc bag. Add the diced chicken and let it marinade for 30 minutes in the fridge.

## Pat dry

-   Paper towels

After marinating, pat the chicken dry with paper towels and set aside.

## Breading

-   Potato starch

Ok, not quite breading since we're using potato starch but same goal. Sprinkle the chicken pieces and make sure they are fully coated with the starch.

## Frying (1st round)

-   Vegetable oil
-   Paper towels

Heat up (roughly at 160°C) enough oil in a pan to cover the chicken pieces. Cook for about 3 minutes. The pieces don't have to be super golden at this point. There will be another round of frying for that.

## Rest for 4 minutes

-   Paper towels

Let the chicken rest on paper towels for about 4 minutes before frying again.

## Frying (2nd round)

-   Vegetable oil
-   Paper towels

This time heat up the oil at roughly 200°C. This is a quick in-and-out action to make the chicken crispy. Cook for 30 seconds. Take out and set aside on some paper towels. Let it cool and it's ready to eat.

## Dipping

-   Kewpie mayo
-   Sriracha sauce

This is totally optional, but I'm a fan of both Kewpie mayo and Sriracha sauce. You can dip your chicken in either or both!

# \[2023-01-10 Tue\] Emacs: org-present in style
---
id: emacs-org-present-in-style
---

I had been meaning to check out David Wilson's [System Crafters](https://systemcrafters.cc) post detailing [his presentations style](https://systemcrafters.net/emacs-tips/presentations-with-org-present/) achieved with the help of [org-present](https://github.com/rlister/org-present) and his own customizations. If you're looking for ways to present from Emacs itself, David's post is well worth a look.

org-present's spartan but effective approach resonated with me. David's touches bring the wonderfully stylish icing to the cake. I personally liked his practice of collapsing slide subheadings by default. This lead me to think about slide navigation in general…

There were two things I wanted to achieve:

1.  Easily jump between areas of interest. Subheadings, links, and code blocks would be a good start.
2.  Collapse all but the current top-level heading within the slide, as navigation focus changes.

A quick search for existing functions led me to `org-next-visible-heading`, `org-next-link`, and `org-next-block`. While these make it easy to jump through jump between headings, links, org block on their own, I wanted to jump to whichever one of these is next (similar a web browser's tab behaviour). In a way, [DWIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM) style.

I wrapped the existing functions to enable returning positions. This gave me `ar/rg-next-visible-heading-pos`, `ar/rg-next-link-pos`, and `ar/rg-next-block-pos` respectively. Now that I can find out the next location of either of these items, I can subsequently glue the navigation logic in a function like `ar/org-present-next-item`. To restore balance to the galaxy, I also added `ar/org-present-previous-item`.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun ar/org-present-next-item (&optional backward)
  "Present and reveal next item."
  (interactive "P")
  ;; Beginning of slide, go to previous slide.

```

Beware, this was a minimal effort (with redundant code, duplication, etc) and should likely be considered a proof of concept of sorts, but the results look promising. You can see a demo in action.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-org-present-in-style/org-navigate_x1.6.webp)

While this was a fun exercise, I can't help but think there must be a cleaner way of doing it or there are existing packages that already do this for you. If you do know, I'd love to know.

Future versions of this code will likely be updated in [my Emacs org config](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/features/fe-org.el).

## Update

Removed a bunch of duplication and now rely primarily on existing `org-next-visible-heading`, `org-next-link`, and `org-next-block`.

# \[2023-01-08 Sun\] Emacs: insert and render SF symbols
---
id: emacs-insert-and-render-sf-symbols
---

About a week ago, I added an Emacs [function to insert SF symbol names](emacs-macro-me-some-sf-symbols/). This is specially useful for SwiftUI. I didn't bother too much with inserting symbols themselves since I hadn't figured out a way to render them for all buffers. That's now changed.

Christian Tietze and Alan Third both have useful posts in this space:

-   [Emacs, fonts and fontsets](http://idiocy.org/emacs-fonts-and-fontsets.html)
-   [Use San Francisco Font for SF Symbols Everywhere in Emacs](https://christiantietze.de/posts/2023/01/use-sf-pro-for-sf-symbols-everywhere-in-emacs/)

I'm currently using the following to render SF symbols in all buffers (macOS only):

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
;; Enable rendering SF symbols on macOS.
(when (memq system-type '(darwin))
  (set-fontset-font t nil "SF Pro Display" nil 'append))
```

Now that I can render SF symbols everywhere, I *may* be more included to use them to spif things up.

I've added `sf-symbol-insert` to [sf.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/ar/sf.el), let's see if usage sticks.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-insert-and-render-sf-symbols/sf-insert-trimmed_x1.8.webp)

# \[2022-12-31 Sat\] Emacs: Macro me some SF Symbols
---
id: emacs-macro-me-some-sf-symbols
---

For inserting SF Symbols in SwiftUI, I typically rely on Apple's [SF Symbols app](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) to browse the symbols's catalog. Once I find a symbol I'm happy with, I copy its name and paste it into my Swift source. This works fairly well.

With Christian Tietze recently posting [how he rendered SF Symbols in Emacs](https://christiantietze.de/posts/2022/12/sf-symbols-emacs-tab-numbers/), I figured there may be a way to shift the above workflow to rely on Emacs completion instead. While I initially went down a rabbit hole to programmatically extract SF symbols (via something like [SFSafeSymbols](https://github.com/SFSafeSymbols/SFSafeSymbols)), I took a step back to rethink the strategy.

From the [SF Symbols app](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/), one can select multiple symbols and copy/paste either the symbols themselves or their respective names. The catch is you can only copy disjointed data. That is, you can copy the symbols or their names, but not both in one go. Let's take a look at what the disjointed data looks like. I've pasted both under separate sections in an Emacs buffer.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-macro-me-some-sf-symbols/disjointed.png)

If I could rejoin these two sets, I would have a lookup table I could easily invoke from Emacs.

There are roughly 4500 symbols, so copying, pasting, along with text manipulation isn't manually feasible. Lucky for us, an Emacs [keyboard macro](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Keyboard-Macros.html) is the perfect hammer for this nail. You can see the macro in action below.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-macro-me-some-sf-symbols/mini-macro_x1.6.webp)

This looks fairly magical (and it is), but when you break it down into its building blocks, it's nothing more than recording your keystrokes and replaying them. Starting with the cursor at the beginning of `square.and.arrow.up`, these are the keystrokes we'd need to record:

C-s
:   [iseach-forward](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Basic-Isearch.html) to search for a character and jump to it

=
:   insert `=` so we jump to == Symbols ==

\<return\>
:   runs [isearch-exit](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Basic-Isearch.html) since we're done jumping.

C-n
:   `next-line`.

C-a
:   `beginning-of-line`.

C-SPC
:   `set-mark-command` to activate the region.

C-f
:   `forward-char` to select symbol.

C-w
:   `kill-ring-save` to cut/kill the symbol.

C-u C-\<space\>
:   `set-mark-command` (with prefix) to jump back to where we started before searching.

C-y
:   `yank` to yank/paste the symbol.

C-\<space\>
:   `set-mark-command` to activate the region.

C-e
:   `end-of-line` to select the entire line.

"
:   As a [smartparens](https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens) user, inserting quote with region places quotes around selection.

C-n
:   `next-line`.

C-a
:   `beginning-of-line`. We are now at a strategic location where we can replay the above commands.

To start/end recording and executing keyboard macros, use:

C-x (
:   [kmacro-start-macro](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Basic-Keyboard-Macro.html)

C-x )
:   [kmacro-end-macro](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Basic-Keyboard-Macro.html)

C-x e
:   [kmacro-end-and-call-macro](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Basic-Keyboard-Macro.html) runs your macro. Press `e` immediately after to execute again.

C-u 0 C-x e
:   [kmacro-end-and-call-macro](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Basic-Keyboard-Macro.html) (with zero prefix) repeat until there is an error.

Our previous example ran on a handful of SF symbols. Let's bring out the big guns and run on the entire dataset. This time, we'll run the entire flow, including macro creation and executing until there is an error (i.e. process the whole lot).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-macro-me-some-sf-symbols/sf-symbol-no-mouse-short_x1.4.webp)

Now that we have our data joined, we can feed it to the humble [completing-read](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Completion.html).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-macro-me-some-sf-symbols/sf-symbols-insert-name.png)

It's worth highlighting that to render SF Symbols in Emacs, we must [propertize our text with one of the macOS SF fonts](https://christiantietze.de/posts/2022/12/sf-symbols-emacs-tab-numbers/), for example "SF Pro".

With all the pieces in place, let's use our new function to insert SF symbol names in a SwiftUI snippet. Since we're using `completing-read` we can fuzzy search our lookups with our favorite completion frameworks (in my case via [ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper)).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-macro-me-some-sf-symbols/sf-search_x1.2.webp)

While this post is macOS-specific, it gives a taste of how powerful Emacs [keyboard macros](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Keyboard-Macros.html) can be. Be sure to check out [Emacs Rocks! Episode 05: Macros in style](https://emacsrocks.com/e05.html) and [Keyboard Macros are Misunderstood - Mastering Emacs](https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/keyboard-macros-are-misunderstood). For those that dabble in elisp, you can appreciate how handy [completing-read](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Completion.html) is with very little code.

The full source to [sf-symbol-insert-name](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/ar/sf.el) is available in my [Emacs config repo](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/). The function is fairly bare bones and has had fairly little testing. Patches totally welcome.

## Update

There is some redundancy in the snippet I had forgotten to remove. Either way, latest version at [sf.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/ar/sf.el).

# \[2022-12-18 Sun\] Emacs: ffmpeg and macOS aliasing commands
---
id: emacs-ffmpeg-and-macos-alias-commands
---

On a recent mastodon [post](https://twit.social/@chris_spackman/109531700714365786), Chris Spackman mentioned he uses Emacs to save [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) commands he's figured out for later usage. Emacs is great for this kind of thing. I've tried different approaches over time and eventually landed on [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command), a small package I wrote. Like Chris, I also wanted a way to invoke magical incantations of known shell commands without having to remember all the details.

Chris's post reminded me of a few use-cases I'd been meaning to add DWIM shell commands for.

### ffmpeg

1.  Trimming seconds from videos
    -   `dwim-shell-commands-video-trim-beginning` using:

        ``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
        ffmpeg -i '<<f>>' -y -ss <<Seconds:5>> -c:v copy -c:a copy '<<fne>>_trimmed.<<e>>'
        ```

    -   `dwim-shell-commands-video-trim-end` using:

        ``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
        ffmpeg -sseof -<<Seconds:5>> -i '<<f>>' -y -c:v copy -c:a copy '<<fne>>_trimmed.<<e>>'
        ```

        Side-node: The `<<Seconds:5>>` placeholder is recognized as a query, so Emacs will prompt you for a numeric value.
2.  Extracting audio from videos
    -   `dwim-shell-commands-video-to-mp3` using:

        ``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
        ffmpeg -i '<<f>>' -vn -ab 128k -ar 44100 -y '<<fne>>.mp3'
        ```

With these new dwim shell commands added, I can easily apply them one after the other. No need to remember command details.

### macOS aliases

After rebuilding Emacs via the wonderful [emacs-plus](https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus), I recently broke my existing `/Applications/Emacs.app` alias. No biggie, one can easily add a [new one alias from macOS Finder](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp1046/mac), but I've been wanting to do it from Emacs. Turns out there's a bit of AppleScript we can turn into a more memorale command like `dwim-shell-commands-macos-make-finder-alias`:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
osascript -e 'tell application \"Finder\" to make alias file to POSIX file \"<<f>>\" at POSIX file \"%s\"'
```

It's highly unlikely I'll remember the AppleScript snippet (are there better ways?), but I'll easily find and invoke my new command with fuzzy searching:

# \[2022-12-12 Mon\] Emacs: Context-aware yasnippets
---
id: emacs-generate-a-swift-initializer
---

Back in 2020, I wrote a semi-automatic [yasnippet](https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet) to [generate Swift initializers](smarter-snippets/). I say semi-automatic because it could have been a little smarter. While it helped generate some of the code, what I really wanted was full context-aware generation. The Swift struct already had a few properties defined, so a smarter yasnippet should have been able to use this info for code generation.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/smarter-snippets/snippet.gif)

With an extra push, we could have written a smarter yasnippet, but it may require a fair bit of parsing logic. Fast forward to today, and bringing context-awareness seems like the right match for [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/). While Tree-sitter can enable faster and more reliable syntax-highlighting in our beloved text editor, it can also power smarter tools. It does so by exposing a semantic snapshot of our source code using a syntax tree.

Let's see how we can use Tree-sitter to realise our original yasnippet vision. We'll start with the same struct snippet we used back in 2020. The goal is to generate an initializer using the existing definitions.

``` swift
struct Coordinate {
  public let x: Int
  public let y: Int
  public let z: Int
}
```

While Emacs will [will soon ship its own Tree-sitter integration](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2022-11/msg01443.html), I've opted to try out the [emacs-tree-sitter](https://github.com/emacs-tree-sitter/elisp-tree-sitter) package as Swift support is currently included in [tree-sitter-langs](https://github.com/emacs-tree-sitter/tree-sitter-langs).

I have much to learn much about Tree-sitter syntax trees, but the package ships with a handy tool to dump the tree via `tree-sitter-debug-mode`.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-generate-a-swift-initializer/syntax-tree.png)

With a syntax tree in mind, one can craft a query to semantically extract parts of the code. In our case, we want property names and types. I've yet to get acquainted with Tree-sitter's [query syntax](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/using-parsers#query-syntax), but the package also ships with another handy tool that helps view query results via `tree-sitter-query-builder`.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-generate-a-swift-initializer/query-builder.png)

The following query extracts all the `let properties` in file. You can see the builder in action above, highlighting our query results.

    (struct_declaration (constant_declaration (identifier) @name (type) @value))

If we want to be more thorough, we should likely cater for classes, vars, int/string literals, etc. so the query needs to be extended as follows. I'm sure it can be written differently, but for now, it does the job.

    (struct_declaration (variable_declaration (identifier) @name (type) @type))
    (struct_declaration (variable_declaration (identifier) @name (string) @value))
    (struct_declaration (variable_declaration (identifier) @name (number) @value))
    (struct_declaration (constant_declaration (identifier) @name (type) @value))
    (struct_declaration (constant_declaration (identifier) @name (string) @value))
    (struct_declaration (constant_declaration (identifier) @name (number) @value))
    (class_declaration (variable_declaration (identifier) @name (type) @type))
    (class_declaration (variable_declaration (identifier) @name (string) @value))
    (class_declaration (variable_declaration (identifier) @name (number) @value))
    (class_declaration (constant_declaration (identifier) @name (type) @type))
    (class_declaration (constant_declaration (identifier) @name (string) @value))
    (class_declaration (constant_declaration (identifier) @name (number) @value))

Now that we got our Tree-sitter query sorted, let's write a little elisp to extract the info we need from the generated tree. We'll write a `swift-class-or-struct-vars-at-point` function to extract the struct (or class) at point and subsequently filter its property names/types using our query. To simplify the result, we'll return a list of alists.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun swift-class-or-struct-vars-at-point ()
  "Return a list of class or struct vars in the form '(((name . \"foo\") (type . \"Foo\")))."
  (cl-assert (seq-contains local-minor-modes 'tree-sitter-mode) "tree-sitter-mode not enabled")
  (let* ((node (or (tree-sitter-node-at-point 'struct_declaration)
                   (tree-sitter-node-at-point 'class_declaration)))
         (vars)
         (var))
    (unless node
      (error "Neither in class nor struct"))
    (mapc
     (lambda (item)
       (cond ((eq 'identifier
                  (tsc-node-type (cdr item)))
              (when var
                (setq vars (append vars (list var))))
              (setq var (list (cons 'name (tsc-node-text
                                           (cdr item))))))
             ((eq 'type
                  (tsc-node-type (cdr item)))
              (setq var (map-insert var 'type (tsc-node-text
                                               (cdr item)))))
             ((eq 'string
                  (tsc-node-type (cdr item)))
              (setq var (map-insert var 'type "String")))
             ((eq 'number
                  (tsc-node-type (cdr item)))
              (setq var (map-insert var 'type "Int")))
             (t (message "%s" (tsc-node-type (cdr item))))))
     (tsc-query-captures
      (tsc-make-query tree-sitter-language
                      "(struct_declaration (variable_declaration (identifier) @name (type) @type))
                       (struct_declaration (variable_declaration (identifier) @name (string) @value))
                       (struct_declaration (variable_declaration (identifier) @name (number) @value))
                       (struct_declaration (constant_declaration (identifier) @name (type) @value))
                       (struct_declaration (constant_declaration (identifier) @name (string) @value))
                       (struct_declaration (constant_declaration (identifier) @name (number) @value))
                       (class_declaration (variable_declaration (identifier) @name (type) @type))
                       (class_declaration (variable_declaration (identifier) @name (string) @value))
                       (class_declaration (variable_declaration (identifier) @name (number) @value))
                       (class_declaration (constant_declaration (identifier) @name (type) @type))
                       (class_declaration (constant_declaration (identifier) @name (string) @value))
                       (class_declaration (constant_declaration (identifier) @name (number) @value))")
      node nil))
    (when var
      (setq vars (append vars (list var))))
    vars))
```

Finally, we write a function to generate a Swift initializer from our property list.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun swift-class-or-struct-initializer-text (vars)
  "Generate a Swift initializer from property VARS."
  (cl-assert (seq-contains local-minor-modes 'tree-sitter-mode) "tree-sitter-mode not enabled")
  (format
   (string-trim
    "
init(%s) {
  %s
}")
   (seq-reduce (lambda (reduced var)
                 (format "%s%s%s: %s"
                         reduced
                         (if (string-empty-p reduced)
                             "" ", ")
                         (map-elt var 'name)
                         (map-elt var 'type)))
               vars "")
   (string-join
    (mapcar (lambda (var)
              (format "self.%s = %s"
                      (map-elt var 'name)
                      (map-elt var 'name)))
            vars)
    "\n  ")))
```

We're so close now. All we need is a simple way invoke our code generator. We can use yasnippet for that, making `init` our expandable keyword.

    # -*- mode: snippet -*-
    # name: init all
    # key: init
    # --
    `(swift-class-or-struct-initializer-text (swift-class-or-struct-vars-at-point))`

And with all that, we've got our yasnippet vision accomplished!

Be sure to check out this year's relevant [EmacsConf](https://emacsconf.org/) talk: [Tree-sitter beyond syntax highlighting](https://emacsconf.org/2022/talks/treesitter/).

All code is now pushed to my [config repo](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/commit/9a44606935e8d57d7b3bde2d8d051defbf254a9e). By the way, I'm not super knowledgable of neither yasnippet nor Tree-sitter. Improvements are totally welcome.

## Update

[Josh Caswell](https://gitlab.com/woolsweater) kindly pointed out a couple of interesting items:

1.  tree-sitter-langs's [Swift grammar is fairly outdated/incomplete](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/zkb7aq/comment/izzjx3l/).
2.  There are more up-to-date Swift grammar implementations currently available:

# \[2022-11-13 Sun\] Emacs: quickly killing processes
---
id: emacs-quick-kill-process
---

Every so often, I need to kill the odd unresponsive process. While I really like `proced` (check out Mickey Petersen's [article](https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/displaying-interacting-processes-proced)), I somehow find myself using macOS's [Activity Monitor](https://support.apple.com/en-bw/guide/activity-monitor/actmaea30277/mac) to this purpose. Kinda odd, considering I prefer to do these kinds of things from Emacs.

What I'd really like is a way to quickly fuzzy search a list of active processes and choose the unresponsive culprid, using my preferred completion frontend (in my case [ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper)).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-quick-kill-process/kill_x1.8.webp)

The function below gives us a fuzzy-searchable process utility. While we could use `ivy-read` directly in our implementation, we're better of using [completing-read](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Completion.html) to remain compatible with other completion frameworks. I'm a big fan of the humble `completing-read`. You feed it a list of candidates and it prompts users to pick one.

To build our process list, we can lean on `proced`'s own source: `proced-process-attributes`. We transform its output to an [alist](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Association-Lists.html), formatting the visible keys to contain the process id, owner, command name, and the command line which invoked the process. Once a process is chosen, we can send a kill signal using ~~signal-process~~ [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) and our *job is done*.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}

                                               candidates) nil t)))

```

I've pushed `dwim-shell-commands-kill-process` to my ~~[config](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/)~~ [dwim-shell-commands.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/commit/b98f45c7901446cf1ab60be2ab648c623e774427). Got suggestions? Alternatives? Lemme know.

## Update

I've moved `dwim-shell-commands-kill-process` from my Emacs [config](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies) to [dwim-shell-commands.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-commands.el). A few advantages:

-   Killing processes is now async.
-   Should anything go wrong, an error message is now accessible.
-   You can easily install via [MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/dwim-shell-command).

If you prefer the previous version (without a dependency on [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command)), have a look at the [initial commit](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/commit/eac4f892eab7a80740ee8ce0c727381886442fb6).

# \[2022-11-06 Sun\] Hey Emacs, change the default macOS app for…
---
id: hey-emacs-change-the-default-macos-app-for
---

A few weeks ago, I [added an "open with"](emacs-open-with-macos-app/) command to [dwim-shell-commands.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-commands.el). It's pretty handy for opening files using an external app (ie. not Emacs) other than the default macOS one.

`dwim-shell-commands-macos-open-with` and `dwim-shell-commands-open-externally` are typically enough for me to handle opening files outside of Emacs. But every now and then I'd like to change the default macOS app associated with specific file types. Now this isn't particularly challenging in macOS, but it does require a little navigating to get to the right place to change this default setting.

Back in March 2020, I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/xenodium/status/1242879439932923909) about [duti](https://github.com/moretension/duti): a command-line utility capable of setting default applications for various document types on macOS. While I liked the ability to change default apps from the command-line, the habit never quite stuck.

Fast forward to 2022. I've been revisiting lots of my command-line usages (specially those that never stuck) and making them more accessible from Emacs via [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command). I seldom change default apps on macOS, so my brain forgets about `duti` itself, let alone its arguments, order, etc. But with a dwim shell command like `dwim-shell-commands-macos-set-default-app`, I can easily invoke the command via [swiper](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper)'s `counsel-M-x` fuzzy terms: *"dwim set"*.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/hey-emacs-change-the-default-macos-app-for/set-default_x1.3.webp)

As an added bonus, I get to reuse `dwim-shell-commands--macos-apps` from "open with" to quickly pick the new default app, making the whole experience pretty snappy.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-commands-macos-set-default-app ()
  "Set default app for file(s)."
  (interactive)
  (let* ((apps (dwim-shell-commands-macos-apps))
         (selection (progn
                      (cl-assert apps nil "No apps found")
                      (completing-read "Set default app: " apps nil t))))
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "Set default app"
     (format "duti -s \"%s\" '<<e>>' all"
             (string-trim
              (shell-command-to-string (format "defaults read '%s/Contents/Info.plist' CFBundleIdentifier"
                                               (map-elt apps selection)))))
     :silent-success t
     :no-progress t
     :utils "duti")))

(defun dwim-shell-commands--macos-apps ()
  "Return alist of macOS apps (\"Emacs\" . \"/Applications/Emacs.app\")."
  (mapcar (lambda (path)
            (cons (file-name-base path) path))
          (seq-sort
           #'string-lessp
           (seq-mapcat (lambda (paths)
                         (directory-files-recursively
                          paths "\\.app$" t (lambda (path)
                                             (not (string-suffix-p ".app" path)))))
                       '("/Applications" "~/Applications" "/System/Applications")))))
```

As usual, I've added `dwim-shell-commands-macos-set-default-app` to [dwim-shell-commands.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-commands.el), which you can install via [MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/dwim-shell-command).

Did you find this tiny integration useful? Check out [Hey Emacs, where did I take that photo?](hey-emacs-where-did-i-take-that-photo/)

# \[2022-11-02 Wed\] Hey Emacs, where did I take that photo?
---
id: hey-emacs-where-did-i-take-that-photo
---

I was recently browsing through an old archive of holiday photos (from [dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html) of course). I wanted to know where the photo was taken, which got me interested in extracting [Exif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif) metadata.

Luckily the [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/) command line utility does the heavy lifting when it comes to extracting metadata. Since I want it quickly accessible from Emacs (in either dired or current buffer), a tiny elisp snippet would give me just that (via [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command)).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/hey-emacs-where-did-i-take-that-photo/dwim-exif_x1.3.webp)

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-commands-image-exif-metadata ()
  "View EXIF metadata in image(s)."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   "View EXIF"
   "exiftool '<<f>>'"
   :utils "exiftool"))
```

The above makes all Exif metadata easily accessible, including the photo's GPS coordinates. But I haven’t quite answered the original question. Where did I take the photo? I now know the coordinates, but I can’t realistically deduce neither the country nor city unless I *manually* feed these values to a reverse geocoding service like [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). *Manually* you say? This is Emacs, so we can throw more elisp glue at the problem, mixed in with a little shell script, and presto! We've now automated the process of extracting metadata, reverse geocoding, and displaying the photo's address in the minibuffer. Pretty nifty.

    if [ -z \"$lon\" ]; then
      echo \"no longitude\"
      exit 1
    fi
    json=$(curl \"https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse?format=json&accept-language=en&lat=${lat}&lon=${lon}&zoom=18&addressdetails=1\")
    echo \"json_start $json json_end\""
   :utils '("exiftool" "curl")
   :silent-success t
   :error-autofocus t
   :on-completion
   (lambda (buffer)
     (with-current-buffer buffer
       (goto-char (point-min))
       (let ((matches '()))
         (while (re-search-forward "^json_start\\(.*?\\)json_end" nil t)
           (push (match-string 1) matches))
         (message "%s" (string-join (seq-map (lambda (json)
                                               (map-elt (json-parse-string json :object-type 'alist) 'display_name))
                                             matches)
                                    "\n")))
       (kill-buffer buffer)))))
```

Displaying the photo's address in the minibuffer is indeed pretty nifty, but what if I’d like to drop a pin in a map for further exploration? This is actually simpler, as there's no need for reverse geocoding. Following a similar recipe, we merely construct an [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) URL and open it in our favourite browser.

# \[2022-10-24 Mon\] Emacs: A welcoming experiment
---
id: emacs-a-welcoming-experiment
---

The `*scratch*` buffer is the first thing I see when I launch an Emacs session. Coupled with [persistent-scratch](https://github.com/Fanael/persistent-scratch), it's served me well over the years. I gotta say though, my scratch buffer accumulates random bits and often becomes a little messy. It's not the most visually appealing landing buffer when launching Emacs. But who cares, I'm only a `C-x b` binding away from invoking `ivy-switch-buffer` to get me wherever I need to be. It's powered by `ivy-use-virtual-buffers`, which remembers recent files across sessions.

Having said all of this, I recently ran into u/pearcidar43's [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/yamj5f/exwm_emacs_is_kinda_comfy_as_a_wm/) showcasing a wonderful Emacs banner. Lucky for us, they [shared](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/yamj5f/comment/itfusm0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) the [image](https://github.com/TanbinIslam43/mydotfiles/blob/main/.doom.d/emacs.png), so I got curious about building a minimal welcome buffer of sorts. Nothing fancy, the only requirements being to load quickly and enable me to get on with my `C-x b` ritual. Throw in a little bonus to exit quickly by pressing just `q` if I so desire.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-a-welcoming-experiment/welcome-minimal_x0.5.webp)

I didn't know a whole lot on how to go about it, so I took a peek at [emacs-dashboard](https://github.com/emacs-dashboard/emacs-dashboard) for inspiration. Turns out, I needed little code to get the desired effect in my `early-init.el`:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun ar/show-welcome-buffer ()
  "Show *Welcome* buffer."
  (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create "*Welcome*")
    (setq truncate-lines t)
    (let* ((buffer-read-only)
           (image-path "~/.emacs.d/emacs.png")
           (image (create-image image-path))
           (size (image-size image))
           (height (cdr size))
           (width (car size))
           (top-margin (floor (/ (- (window-height) height) 2)))
           (left-margin (floor (/ (- (window-width) width) 2)))
           (prompt-title "Welcome to Emacs!"))
      (erase-buffer)
      (setq mode-line-format nil)
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (insert (make-string top-margin ?\n ))
      (insert (make-string left-margin ?\ ))
      (insert-image image)
      (insert "\n\n\n")
      (insert (make-string (floor (/ (- (window-width) (string-width prompt-title)) 2)) ?\ ))
      (insert prompt-title))
    (setq cursor-type nil)
    (read-only-mode +1)
    (switch-to-buffer (current-buffer))
    (local-set-key (kbd "q") 'kill-this-buffer)))

(setq initial-scratch-message nil)
(setq inhibit-startup-screen t)

(when (< (length command-line-args) 2)
  (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook (lambda ()
                                  (when (display-graphic-p)
                                    (ar/show-welcome-buffer)))))
```

This being Emacs, I can bend it as far as needed. In my case, I didn't need much, so I can probably stop here. It was a fun experiment. I'll even [try using it](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/commit/90c689def913a9bccdd408ef609c7f99a5cce1fb) for a little while and see if it sticks. I'm sure there's plenty more that could be handled (edge cases, resizes, etc.), but if you want something more established, consider something like [emacs-dashboard](https://github.com/emacs-dashboard/emacs-dashboard) instead. I haven't used it myself, but is [pretty popular](https://melpa.org/#/dashboard).

# \[2022-10-14 Fri\] Emacs: Open with macOS app
---
id: emacs-open-with-macos-app
---

On a recent Reddit [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/y2dfma/comment/is4ygl8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), tdstoff7 asked if I had considered writing an "Open with" DWIM shell command for those times one would like to open a file externally using an app other than the default. I hadn't, but nice idea.

Take images as an example. Though Emacs can display them quickly, I also open images externally using the default app ([Preview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preview_(macOS)) in my case). But then there are those times when I'd like to open with a different app for editing (maybe something like GIMP). It'd be nice to quickly choose which app to open with.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-open-with-macos-app/open-with_x2.webp)

There isn't much to the code. Get a list of apps, ask user to pick one (via [completing-read](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Programmed-Completion.html)), and launch the external app via `dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files`.

There's likely a better way of getting a list of available apps (happy to take suggestions), but searching in "/Applications" "\~/Applications" and "/System/Applications" does the job for now.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-commands-macos-open-with ()
  "Convert all marked images to jpg(s)."
  (interactive)
  (let* ((apps (seq-sort
                #'string-lessp

                              (directory-files-recursively
                               paths "\\.app$" t (lambda (path)
                                                  (not (string-suffix-p ".app" path)))))
                            '("/Applications" "~/Applications" "/System/Applications"))))
         (selection (progn
                      (cl-assert apps nil "No apps found")
                      (completing-read "Open with: "
                                       (mapcar (lambda (path)
                                                 (propertize (file-name-base path) 'path path))
                                               apps)))))

# \[2022-10-12 Wed\] Improving on Emacs macOS sharing
---
id: emacs-macos-sharing-dwim-style-improved
---

A quick follow-up to [Emacs: macOS sharing (DWIM style)](emacs-macos-share-from-dired-dwim-style/)… Though functional, the implementation had a couple of drawbacks.

Tohiko [noticed fullscreen wasn't working at all](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/y1tneh/comment/is0pgkf) while Calvin [proposed enumeration for tighter Emacs integration](https://lobste.rs/s/qga1px/emacs_macos_sharing_dwim_style#c_safiuw).

Calvin's suggestion enables using [completing-read](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Completion.html) to pick the sharing service. This makes the integration feel more at home. As a bonus, it also enables sharing from fullscreen Emacs.

As an [ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) user, you can see a vertical list of sharing services.

UPDATE: See an improved implementation [here](emacs-macos-sharing-dwim-style-improved).

A few days ago, [I wrote dwim-shell-commands-macos-reveal-in-finder](emacs-reveal-in-finder-dwim-style/). While I've written a bunch of other [dwim-shell-commands](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-commands.el), what set this case apart was the use of [Swift](https://www.swift.org/) to glue an Emacs workflow.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(defun dwim-shell-commands-macos-reveal-in-finder ()
  "Reveal selected files in macOS Finder."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   "Reveal in Finder"
   "import AppKit
    NSWorkspace.shared.activateFileViewerSelecting([\"<<*>>\"].map{URL(fileURLWithPath:$0)})"
   :join-separator ", "
   :silent-success t
   :shell-pipe "swift -"))
```

There is hardly any Swift involved, yet it scratched a real itch I couldn't otherwise reach (reveal multiple dired files in macOS's [Finder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finder_(software))).

divinedominion's [reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/xzt3gx/comment/irrwoya/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) got me thinking of other use-cases, so I figured why not push this Swift-elisp beeswax a little further… Let's add macOS's sharing ability via [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command), so I could invoke it from the comfort of my beloved [dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html) or any 'ol Emacs buffer visiting a file.

I love seeing what others get up to by using `dwim-shell-command`. Are there new magical command-line utilities out there I don't know about? In this instance, I got to learn about [feh](https://feh.finalrewind.org/) and [dragon](https://github.com/mwh/dragon).

[feh](https://feh.finalrewind.org/) is a no-frills image viewer for console users while [dragon](https://github.com/mwh/dragon) is a simple drag-and-drop source/sink for X or Wayland. Both utilities are great uses of `dwim-shell-command`, enabling a seamless transition from Emacs to the *outside world*. These days I'm rarely on a linux box, so I was keen to ensure macOS had these cases covered.

[Preview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preview_(macOS)) is a solid macOS equivalent to [feh](https://feh.finalrewind.org/). `Preview` is already macOS's default image viewer. A simple `open '<<f>>'` would do the job, but if we'd like to make this command more portable, we can accomodate as follows:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(defun dwim-shell-commands-open-externally ()
  "Open file(s) externally."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   "Open externally"
   (if (eq system-type 'darwin)
       "open '<<f>>'"
     "xdg-open '<<f>>'")
   :silent-success t
   :utils "open"))
```

Special mention goes to Bozhidar Batsov's [crux](https://github.com/bbatsov/crux) which achieves similar functionality via `crux-open-with`. [crux](https://github.com/bbatsov/crux) provides a bunch of other useful functions. Some of my favourites being `crux-duplicate-current-line-or-region`, `crux-transpose-windows`, `crux-delete-file-and-buffer`, and `crux-rename-buffer-and-file`, but I digress.

Moving on to a [dragon](https://github.com/mwh/dragon) equivalent on macOS, I thought I had it covered via [reveal-in-osx-finder](https://github.com/kaz-yos/reveal-in-osx-finder) or [reveal-in-folder](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/reveal-in-folder). Turns out, neither of these reveal multiple [dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html)-selected files within [Finder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finder_(software)). At first, I thought this could be easily achieved by passing additional flags/params to macOS's `open` command, but it doesn't seem to be the case. Having said that, this [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7652928/launch-finder-window-with-specific-files-selected), has a solution in Objective-C, which is where things got a little more interesting. You see, back in July I [added multi-language support](emacs-dwim-shell-command-multi-language/) to [dwim-shell-command](emacs-dwim-shell-command-multi-language/) and while it highlighted language flexibility, I hadn't yet taken advantage of this feature myself. That is, until today.

The Objective-C snippet from the Stack Overflow post can be written as a Swift one-liner. Ok I lie. It's actually two lines, counting the import, but you can see that this multi-language Emacs transition/integration is pretty easy to add.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-commands-macos-reveal-in-finder ()
  "Reveal selected files in macOS Finder."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   "Reveal in Finder"
   "import AppKit
    NSWorkspace.shared.activateFileViewerSelecting([\"<<*>>\"].map{URL(fileURLWithPath:$0)})"
   :join-separator ", "
   :silent-success t
   :shell-pipe "swift -"))
```

`<<*>>` is the centrepiece of the snippet above. It gets instantiated with a list of files joined using the `", "` separator.

``` swift
NSWorkspace.shared.activateFileViewerSelecting(["/path/to/file1", "/path/to/file2"].map { URL(fileURLWithPath: $0) })
```

The proof of the pudding is of course in the eating, so ummm let's show it in action:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-reveal-in-finder-dwim-style/dwim-reveal.webp)

I should mention the webp animation above was also created using my trusty `dwim-shell-commands-video-to-webp` also backed by [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command).

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-commands-video-to-webp ()
  "Convert all marked videos to webp(s)."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   "Convert to webp"
   "ffmpeg -i '<<f>>' -vcodec libwebp -filter:v fps=fps=10 -compression_level 3 -lossless 1 -loop 0 -preset default -an -vsync 0 '<<fne>>'.webp"
   :utils "ffmpeg"))

If you haven't heard of [Plain Org](https://plainorg.com), it gives you access to [org](https://orgmode.org) files on iOS while away from your beloved [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

Hadn't had time to post, but v1.5 has been available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1578965002) for a couple of weeks now. The update is mostly a bugfix release, primarily addressing inline editing issues that appeared on iOS 16, along with a few other changes:

-   Render form feeds at end of headings at all times.
-   Fixes new files not recognized by org-roam.
-   Fixes share sheet saving from cold launch.
-   Fixes inline editing on iOS 16.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v15-released/po.png)

I love org markup, but we (iPhone + org users) are a fairly niche bunch. If you're finding Plain Org useful, **please help support this effort** by getting the word out. Tell your friends, [tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Plain%20Org%20https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid1578965002%20), or blog about it.

id: dwim-shell-command-usages-pdftotext-and-scp

[dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) is a little Emacs package I wrote to enable crafting more reusable shell commands. I intended to use it as an [async-shell-command](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shell.html) alternative (and I do these days). The more surprising win was bringing lots of command-line utilities (sometimes with complicated invocations) and making them quickly accessible. I no longer need to remember their respective parameters, order, flags, etc.

I've migrated most [one-liners](emacs-password-protect-current-pdf-revisited/) and [scripts](png-to-icns-emacs-dwim-style/) I had to [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) equivalents. They are available at [dwim-shell-commands.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-commands.el). Having said that, it's great to discover new usages from `dwim-shell-command` users.

Take [u/TiMueller](https://www.reddit.com/user/TiMueller/)'s Reddit comment, [showcasing pdftotext](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/w8s2ov/comment/iq7idav/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Neat utility I was unaware of. It does as it says on the tin and converts a pdf to text. Can be easily saved to your accessible repertoire with:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-commands-pdf-to-txt ()
  "Convert pdf to txt."
  (interactive)

[tareefdev](https://github.com/tareefdev) wanted a quick command to [secure copy](https://linux.die.net/man/1/scp) remote files to a local directory. Though this use-case is already covered by Tramp, I suspect a DWIM command would make it a little more convenient (async by default). However, Tramp paths aren't usable from the shell unless we massage them a little. We can use `dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files`'s `:post-process-template` to drop the "/ssh:" prefix.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}

Setting Emacs up to use your system trash can potentially save your bacon if you mistakenly delete a file, say from [dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html).

Unsurprisingly, the trash safety net also extends to other Emacs areas. For example, discarding files from [Magit](https://magit.vc/) (via `magit-discard`) becomes a recoverable operation. As an [eshell](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html) user, the trash can also help you recover from `rm` blunders.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/rm-important-txt-oh-sht/recovered_x1.6.webp)

You can enable macOS system trash in Emacs by setting `trash-directory` along with defining `system-move-file-to-trash`:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(setq trash-directory "~/.Trash")

;; See `trash-directory' as it requires defining `system-move-file-to-trash'.
(defun system-move-file-to-trash (file)
  "Use \"trash\" to move FILE to the system trash."
  (cl-assert (executable-find "trash") nil "'trash' must be installed. Needs \"brew install trash\"")
  (call-process "trash" nil 0 nil "-F"  file))

Last year, I wrote a little script to [cycle through window layouts via Hammerspoon](cycling-window-layouts-via-hammerspoon). The cycling set I chose didn't stick, so here's another go.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/cycling-through-window-layout-revisited/cycle_layout.webp)

``` lua
function reframeFocusedWindow()
   local win = hs.window.focusedWindow()
   local maximizedFrame = win:screen():frame()
   maximizedFrame.x = maximizedFrame.x + 15
   maximizedFrame.y = maximizedFrame.y + 15
   maximizedFrame.w = maximizedFrame.w - 30
   maximizedFrame.h = maximizedFrame.h - 30

   local leftFrame = win:screen():frame()
   leftFrame.x = leftFrame.x + 15
   leftFrame.y = leftFrame.y + 15
   leftFrame.w = leftFrame.w / 2 - 15
   leftFrame.h = leftFrame.h - 30

   local rightFrame = win:screen():frame()
   rightFrame.x = rightFrame.w / 2
   rightFrame.y = rightFrame.y + 15
   rightFrame.w = rightFrame.w / 2 - 15
   rightFrame.h = rightFrame.h - 30

   if win:frame() == maximizedFrame then
     win:setFrame(leftFrame)
     return
   end

   if win:frame() == leftFrame then
     win:setFrame(rightFrame)
     return
   end

   win:setFrame(maximizedFrame)
end

hs.hotkey.bind({"alt"}, "F", reframeFocusedWindow)
```

Looping through layouts is done with a global key-binding of `option f` or, if familiar with a macOS keyboard, `⌥ f`.

For those unfamiliar with [Hammerspoon](http://hammerspoon.org/)… If you're a tinkerer and a macOS user, you'd love [Hammerspoon](http://hammerspoon.org/). Like elisp gluing all things Emacs, Hammerspoon uses Lua to glue all things macOS. For example, here's a stint at [writing a narrowing utility for macOS](emacs-utilities-for-your-os/) using [chooser](http://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/hs.chooser.html).

# \[2022-08-18 Thu\] dwim-shell-command with template prompts
---
id: dwim-shell-command-with-template-prompts
---

Somewhat recently, I wanted to quickly create an empty/transparent png file. [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/)'s convert has you covered here. Say you want a transparent 200x400 image, you can get it with:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
convert -verbose -size 200x400 xc:none empty200x400.png
```

Great, I now know the one-liner for it. But because I'm in the mood of saving these as [seamless command-line utils](seamless-command-line-utils/), I figured I should save the [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) equivalent.

I wanted configurable image dimensions, so I used [read-number](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/calc/Formatting-Lisp-Functions.html) together with [format](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Formatting-Strings.html) to create the templated command and fed it to `dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files`. Job done:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-commands-make-transparent-png ()
  "Create a transparent png."
  (interactive)
  (let ((width (read-number "Width: " 200))
        (height (read-number "Height: " 200)))
    (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
     "Create transparent png"
     (format "convert -verbose -size %dx%d xc:none '<<empty%dx%d.png(u)>>'"
             width height width height)
     :utils "convert")))
```

The resulting `dwim-shell-commands-make-transparent-png` is fairly simple, but [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) aims to remove friction so you're more inclined to save reusable commands. In this case, we can shift querying and formatting into the template.

`<<Width:200>>` can be interpreted as "ask the user for a value using the suggested prompt and default value."

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/dwim-shell-command-with-template-prompts/query.png)

With template queries in mind, `dwim-shell-commands-make-transparent-png` can be further reduced to essentially the interactive command boilerplate and the template itself:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-commands-make-transparent-png ()
  "Create a transparent png."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   "Create transparent png"
   "convert -verbose -size <<Width:200>>x<<Height:200>> xc:none '<<empty<<Width:200>>x<<Height:200>>.png(u)>>'"
   :utils "convert"))
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/dwim-shell-command-with-template-prompts/empty.webp)

Note: Any repeated queries (same prompt and default) are treated as equal. That is, ask the user once and replace everywhere. If you'd like to request separate values, change either prompt or the default value.

# \[2022-08-14 Sun\] Seamless command-line utils
---
id: seamless-command-line-utils
---

Just the other day, I received a restaurant menu split into a handful of image files. I wanted to forward the menu to others but figured I should probably send it as a single file.

ImageMagick's [convert](https://imagemagick.org/script/convert.php) command-line utility works great for this purpose. Feed it some images and it creates a pdf for you:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
convert image1.png image2.png image3.png combined.pdf
```

Using `convert` for this purpose was pretty straightforward. I'm sure I'll use it again in a similar context, but what if I can make future usage more seamless? In the past, I would just make a note of usage and revisit when needed. Though this works well enough, it often requires some amount of manual work (looking things up, tweaking command, etc) if you happen to forget the command syntax.

I wanted common one-liners (or [longer shell scripts](png-to-icns-emacs-dwim-style/)) to be easily reusable and accessible from Emacs. Turns out, the [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) experiment is working fairly well for this purpose. In addition to providing template expansion, it generally [tries to do what I mean](emacs-dwim-shell-command/) (focus when needed, reveal new files, rename buffers, etc).

Here's how I saved the `convert` command instance for future usage:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-commands-join-as-pdf ()
  "Join all marked images as a single pdf."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   "Join as pdf"
   "convert -verbose '<<*>>' '<<joined.pdf(u)>>'"
   :utils "convert"))
```

From now on, any time I'd like to join multiple files into a pdf, I can now select them all and invoke `dwim-shell-commands-join-as-pdf`.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/seamless-command-line-utils/joined_minimal_x1.2.webp)

In the saved command, `'<<*>>'` expands to either [dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html) selected files or whatever file happens to be open in the current buffer. The buffer file isn't of much help for joining multiple items, but can be handy for other instances (say I want to convert current image to jpeg).

Moving on to `'<<joined.pdf(u)>>'`, we could have just written as `joined.pdf`, but wrapping it ensures the resulting file name is unique. That is, if `joined.pdf` already exists, write `joined(1).pdf` instead.

These kinds of command-line integrations are working well for me. Take the webp animation above, it was created by invoking `dwim-shell-commands-video-to-webp` on a `.mov` file. Easy peasy. While I can easily memorize the `convert` command for the pdf instance, I'm hopeless in the webp scenario:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
ffmpeg -i '<<f>>' -vcodec libwebp -filter:v fps=fps=10 -compression_level 3 -lossless 1 -loop 0 -preset default -an -vsync 0 '<<fne>>'.webp
```

While searching through command line history helps to quickly re-spin previous commands, it requires remembering the actual utility used for any particular action. On the other hand, wrapping with Emacs functions enables me to remember the action itself, using more memorable names. Also, fuzzy searching works a treat.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/seamless-command-line-utils/fuzzy.png)

It's been roughly a month since I started playing around with this idea of wrapping command-line utilities more seamlessly.

I recently ran a little experiment to bring macOS's [long-press-accents-like behavior](an-accentuated-emacs-experiment/) to Emacs. What I forgot to mention is that macOS's character viewer *just works* from our beloved editor.

If you have a newer MacBook model, you can press the 🌐 key to summon the emoji picker (character viewer). You may need to set this key binding [from macOS keyboard preferences](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp1560/mac).

I'm happy to take this Emacs freebie, kthxbye.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-freebie-macos-emoji-picker/hearts_x1.5.webp)

Edits:

-   Like other macOS apps, this dialog can be invoked via control-command-space (thanks [mtndewforbreakfast](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wfja3n/comment/iiv7ptb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). Note: you'd lose this ability if you `(setq mac-command-modifier 'meta)` in your config.
-   The 🌐 key is a feature on newer MacBook hardware and likely needs configuration (thanks [Fabbi-](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/wfja3n/comment/iivnwxt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)).

1.  Copy URL from browser.

3.  Enjoy picture in picture from Emacs ;)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/dwim-shell-command-video-streams/mpv.webp)

What's the secret sauce? Very little. Invoke the awesome [mpv](https://mpv.io/) with a wrapping function using `dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files`.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-commands-mpv-stream-clipboard-url ()
  "Stream clipboard URL using mpv."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files

   :utils "mpv"
   :no-progress t
   :error-autofocus t
   :silent-success t))
```

The typical progress bar kinda got in the way, so I added a new option `:no-progress` to `dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files`, so it can be used for cases like this one.

macOS has a wonderful input mechanism where you press and hold a key on your keyboard to display the accent menu. It's easy to internalize: *long press "a" if you want to input "á"*.

On Emacs, *C-x 8 ' a* would be the equivalent, but it just didn't stick for me. Fortunately, there's an alternative, using dead keys. Mickey Petersen gives a [wonderful introduction](https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/diacritics-in-emacs). Having said all this, I still longed for macOS's input mechanism.

Thanks to Christian Tietze's [post](https://twitter.com/ctietze/status/1552446492559958017), I discovered the [accent](https://github.com/elias94/accent) package. While it doesn't handle *press-and-hold*, it does the heavy lifting of offering a menu with character options. If I could just bring that *press-and-hold*…

My initial attempt was to use [key chords](https://github.com/emacsorphanage/key-chord) (via [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package)):

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(use-package accent
  :ensure t
  :chords (("aa" . ar/spanish-accent-menu)
           ("ee" . ar/spanish-accent-menu)
           ("ii" . ar/spanish-accent-menu)
           ("oo" . ar/spanish-accent-menu)
           ("uu" . ar/spanish-accent-menu)
           ("AA" . ar/spanish-accent-menu)
           ("EE" . ar/spanish-accent-menu)
           ("II" . ar/spanish-accent-menu)
           ("OO" . ar/spanish-accent-menu)
           ("UU" . ar/spanish-accent-menu)
           ("nn" . ar/spanish-accent-menu)
           ("NN" . ar/spanish-accent-menu)
           ("??" . ar/spanish-accent-menu)
           ("!!" . ar/spanish-accent-menu))
  :config
  (defun ar/spanish-accent-menu ()
    (interactive)
    (let ((accent-diacritics
           '((a (á))
             (e (é))
             (i (í))
             (o (ó))
             (u (ú ü))
             (A (Á))
             (E (É))
             (I (Í))
             (O (Ó))
             (U (Ú Ü))
             (n (ñ))
             (N (Ñ))
             (\? (¿))
             (! (¡)))))
      (ignore-error quit
        (accent-menu)))))
```

While it kinda works, "nn" quickly got in the way of my n/p [magit](https://magit.vc/) navigation. Perhaps key chords are still an option for someone who doesn't need the "nn" chord, but being a Spanish speaker, I need that "ñ" from long "n" presses!

I'm now trying a little experiment using an `after-change-functions` hook to monitor text input and present the accent menu. I'm sure there's a better way (anyone with ideas?). For now, it gives me something akin to *press-and-hold.*

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/an-accentuated-emacs-experiment/accentuated.webp)

I'm wrapping the hook with a minor mode to easily enable/disable whenever needed. I'm also overriding `accent-diacritics` to only include the characters I typically need.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(use-package accent
  :ensure t
  :hook ((text-mode . accent-menu-mode)
         (org-mode . accent-menu-mode)
         (message-mode . accent-menu-mode))
  :config
  (setq accent-diacritics '((a (á))
                            (e (é))
                            (i (í))
                            (o (ó))
                            (u (ú ü))
                            (A (Á))
                            (E (É))
                            (I (Í))
                            (O (Ó))
                            (U (Ú Ü))
                            (n (ñ))

                                         accent-diacritics)
                                 (accent-menu-monitor--buffer-char-string beginning))
                 (string-equal (accent-menu-monitor--buffer-char-string (1- beginning))
                               (accent-menu-monitor--buffer-char-string beginning)))
        (delete-backward-char 1)
        (ignore-error quit
          (accent-menu)))
      (setq accent-menu-monitor--last-edit-time edit-time)))

  (defun accent-menu-monitor--buffer-char-string (at)
    (when (and (>= at (point-min))
               (< at (point-max)))
      (buffer-substring-no-properties at (+ at 1)))))
```

As a bonus, it ocurred to me that I could use the same *press-and-hold* to handle question marks in Spanish (from my UK keyboard).

# \[2022-07-28 Thu\] dwim-shell-command improvements
---
id: dwim-shell-command-improvements
---

Added a few improvements to [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command).

## Dired region

In DWIM style, if you happen to have a [dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html) region selected, use region files instead. There's no need to explicitly mark them.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/dwim-shell-command-improvements/backup_x2.webp)

## Clipboard (kill-ring) replacement

Use `<<cb>>` to substitute with clipboard content. This is handy for cloning git repos, using a URL copied from your browser.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
git clone <<cb>>
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/dwim-shell-command-improvements/clone.webp)

This illustrates `<<cb>>` usage, but you may want to use `dwim-shell-commands-git-clone-clipboard-url` from [dwim-shell-commands.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-commands.el) instead. It does the same thing internally, but makes the command more accessible.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-commands-git-clone-clipboard-url ()
  "Clone git URL in clipboard to `default-directory'."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   (format "Clone %s" (file-name-base (current-kill 0)))
   "git clone <<cb>>"
   :utils "git"))
```

## Counter replacement

Use `<<n>>` to substitute with a counter. You can also use `<<3n>>` to start the counter at 3.

Handy if you'd like to consistently rename or copy files.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
mv '<<f>>' 'image(<<n>>).png'
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/dwim-shell-command-improvements/numberedsorted_x2.2.webp)

Can also use an alphabetic counter with `<<an>>`. Like the numeric version, can use any letter to start the counter with.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
mv '<<f>>' 'image(<<an>>).png'
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/dwim-shell-command-improvements/alphacount_x2.2.webp)

## Prefix counter

Use a [prefix command argument](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Prefix-Command-Arguments.html) on `dwim-shell-commands` to repeat the command a number of times. Combined with a counter, you can make multiple copies of a single file.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/dwim-shell-command-improvements/repeat.webp)

## Optional error prompt

Set `dwim-shell-command-prompt-on-error` to nil to skip error prompts. Focus process buffers automatically instead.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/dwim-shell-command-improvements/couldnt.png)

## Configurable prompt

By default, `dwim-shell-command` shows all supported placeholders. You can change that prompt to something shorter using `dwim-shell-command-prompt`.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/dwim-shell-command-improvements/prompt.jpg)

## ⚠️ Use with care ⚠️

The changes are pretty fresh. Please use with caution (specially the counter support).

My pull request to add [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) to [melpa](https://melpa.org/) has been [merged](https://github.com/melpa/melpa/pull/8129). Soon, you'll be able to install [directly](https://melpa.org/#/dwim-shell-command) from Milkypostman’s Emacs Lisp Package Archive.

`dwim-shell-command` is another way to invoke shell commands from our beloved editor. Why a different way? It does lots of little things for you, removing friction you didn't realise you had. You can check out the [README](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command), but you'll appreciate it much more once you try it out.

In addition, it's enabled me to bring lots of command-line tools into my Emacs config and make them highly accessible. You can see my usages over at [dwim-shell-command-commands.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/ar/dwim-shell-command-commands.el).

What kind of command-line tools? ffmpeg, convert, gifsycle, atool, qdpf, plutil, qrencode, du, sips, iconutil, and git (so far anyway). Below is a simple example, but would love to [hear](https://twitter.com/xenodium) how you get to use it.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-command-audio-to-mp3 ()
  "Convert all marked audio to mp3(s)."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   "Convert to mp3"
   "ffmpeg -stats -n -i '<<f>>' -acodec libmp3lame '<<fne>>.mp3'"
   :utils "ffmpeg"))
```

# \[2022-07-16 Sat\] A lifehack for your shell
---
id: a-lifehack-for-your-shell
---

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-lifehack-for-your-shell/unzip_x2.gif)

I'm a fan of the [unzip](http://infozip.sourceforge.net/mans/unzip.html) command line utility that ships with macOS. I give it a .zip file and it unzips it for me. No flags or arguments to remember (for my typical usages anyway). Most importantly, I've fully internalized the `unzip` command into muscle memory, probably because of its *perfect mnemonic*.

But then there's .tar, .tar.gz, .tar.xz, .rar, and a whole world of compression archives, often requiring different tools, flags, etc. and I need to remember those too.

Can't remember where I got this "life hack" from, but it suggests something along the lines of…

::: center
*Once you find a lost item at home, place it in the first spot you looked.*
:::

Great, I'll find things quickly. Win.

Now, I still remember a couple of unarchiving commands from memory (looking at you `tar xvzf`), but I've noticed the first word that pops into mind when extracting is always `unzip`.

There's the great [atool](https://www.nongnu.org/atool/) wrapper out there to extract all kinds of archives (would love to hear of others), but unlucky for me, its name never comes to mind as quickly as `unzip` does.

With "life hack" in mind, let's just create an `unzip` [eshell](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html) alias to `atool`. Next time I need to unarchive anything, the first word that comes to mind (unzip!) will quickly get me on my way…

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
alias unzip 'atool --extract --explain $1'
```

Or if you prefer to add to your Emacs config:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(eshell/alias "unzip" "atool --extract --explain $1")
```

While [I'm fan of Emacs eshell](yasnippet-in-emacs-eshell/), it's not everyone's cup of tea. Lucky for us all, aliases are a popular feature across shells. Happy unzipping!

## Bonus

Since I'm a keen on using "unzip" mnemonic everywhere in Emacs (not just my shell), I now have a [DWIM shell-command](emacs-dwim-shell-command/) for it:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-command-unzip ()
  "Unzip all marked archives (of any kind) using `atool'."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   "Unzip" "atool --extract --explain '<<f>>'"
   :utils "atool"))
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/a-lifehack-for-your-shell/unzip-dired_x1.5.gif)

## UPDATE:

[Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/) has great [comments](https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell). Thanks all:

### Aliases missing on remote machines

Concerns about aliases [not available on remote machines](https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell#c_mqxo73). Valid. Certainly brings challenges if you can't modify the environment on the remote machine. The severity would depend on how frequently you have to do this. Fortunately for me, it's infrequent.

Additionally, if accessing remote machine via [eshell](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html), this is a non-issue. You get to transparently bring most of your environment with you anyway.

### Unzip keyword is overloaded

The alias is [overloading the unzip command](https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell#c_78nnwt). I know. It's a little naughty. Going with it for now. I used to use "extract" (also in comments), which I still like but somehow "unzip" still wins my memory race. [There's also "x"](https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell#c_73bzze) (nice option), which seems to originate from [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto). I could consider unzipp, unzip1, or some other variation.

Not sure how I missed this, but there's also an [existing alias for atool](https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell#c_ra6sbf): aunpack. Could be a great alternative.

### Pause before extracting archives

Valid [point](https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell#c_73bzze). In my case, the pause typically happens *before* I invoke the alias.

### Littering

If the archive didn't have a root dir, it can [litter your current directory](https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell#c_7fsart). Indeed a pain to clean up. For this, we can atool's `--subdir` param to *always create subdirectory when extracting*.

### Alias to retrain

[Neat trick](https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell#c_yr1jby): `alias unzip = “echo ‘use atool’”` to help retrain yourself. Reminds me of Emacs [guru-mode](https://github.com/bbatsov/guru-mode).

### atool alternatives

Nice to see other options suggested [dtrx](https://github.com/moonpyk/dtrx) ([comment](https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell#c_mutdjl)), [archiver](https://github.com/mholt/archiver) ([comment](https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell#c_nlsk7w)), [unar](https://github.com/ashang/unar) ([comment](https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell#c_90dk1l)), bsdtar from [libarchive](https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive) ([comment](https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell#c_ojy6ah)), [unp](https://packages.debian.org/stable/unp), [patool](https://wummel.github.io/patool/), and the tangentially related [zgrep](https://www.nongnu.org/zutils/zutils.html) ([comment](https://lobste.rs/s/qaimmg/lifehack_for_your_shell#c_vp8fdw)).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-zoneb-tob-lift-you-up/zone.gif)

As I prune my [Emacs config](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/) off, I came across a forgotten bit of elisp I wrote about 6 years ago. While it's not going to power up your Emacs fu, it may lift your spirits, or maybe just aid discovery of new words.

You see, I had forgotten about [zone.el](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/play/zone.el) altogether: a fabulous package to tickle your heart. You can think of it as screensaver built into Emacs.

If the built-in zones don't do it for ya, check out the few on melpa ([nyan](https://depp.brause.cc/zone-nyan/), [sl](https://github.com/kawabata/zone-sl), and [rainbow](added-emacs-zone-rainbow/)).

So, my nostalgic bit of elisp dates `Jun 17 2016`: a basic but functional zone ([zone-words](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/ar/zone-words.el)), displaying words from [WordNet](http://wordnet.princeton.edu/). Surely the package can use plenty of improvements ([here's one](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/commit/00215e215be1413ea9d0085dd2de5123c635b8c0)), but hey this is Emacs and pretty much all existing code will run, no matter how old. In Emacs time, 2016 is practically yesterday!

# \[2022-07-10 Sun\] Emacs: DWIM shell command (multi-language)
---
id: emacs-dwim-shell-command-multi-language
---

UPDATE: [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) is now available on [melpa](https://melpa.org/#/dwim-shell-command).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-dwim-shell-command-multi-language/csv.gif)

I keep on [goofying around](png-to-icns-emacs-dwim-style/) with [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) and it's sibling `dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files` from [dwim-shell-command.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-command.el).

In addition to defaulting to [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell), `dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files` now support other shells and languages. This comes in handy if you have snippets in different languages and would like to easily invoke them from Emacs. Multi-language support enables "using the best tool for the job" kinda thing. Or maybe you just happen to know how to solve a particular problem in a specific language.

Let's assume you have an existing Python snippet to convert files from csv to json. With `dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files`, you can invoke the Python snippet to operate on either [dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html) or buffer files.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-command-csv-to-json-via-python ()
  "Convert csv file to json (via Python)."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   "Convert csv file to json (via Python)."
   "
import csv
import json
text = json.dumps({ \"values\": list(csv.reader(open('<<f>>')))})
fpath = '<<fne>>.json'
with open(fpath , 'w') as f:
  f.write(text)"
   :shell-util "python"
   :shell-args "-c"))
```

Or, maybe you prefer Swift and already had a snippet for the same thing?

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-command-csv-to-json-via-swift ()
  "Convert csv file to json (via Swift)."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   "Convert csv file to json (via Swift)."
   "
    import Foundation
    import TabularData
    let filePath = \"<<f>>\"
    print(\"reading \\(filePath)\")
    let content = try String(contentsOfFile: filePath).trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)
    let parsedCSV = content.components(separatedBy: CSVWritingOptions().newline).map{
      $0.components(separatedBy: \",\")
    }
    let jsonEncoder = JSONEncoder()
    let jsonData = try jsonEncoder.encode([\"value\": parsedCSV])
    let json = String(data: jsonData, encoding: String.Encoding.utf8)
    let outURL = URL(fileURLWithPath:\"<<fne>>.json\")
    try json!.write(to: outURL, atomically: true, encoding: String.Encoding.utf8)
    print(\"wrote \\(outURL)\")"
   :shell-pipe "swift -"))
```

You can surely solve the same problem in elisp, but hey it's nice to have options and flexibility.

UPDATE: [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) is now available on [melpa](https://melpa.org/#/dwim-shell-command).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/png-to-icns-emacs-dwim-style/icns.gif)

Since [writing a DWIM version of the shell-command](emacs-dwim-shell-command/), I've been having a little fun [revisiting command line utilities](emacs-password-protect-current-pdf-revisited/) I sometimes invoke from my beloved editor. In this instance, converting a png file to an icns icon. What's more interesting about this case is that it's not just a one-liner, but a short script in itself. Either way, it's just as easy to invoke from Emacs using `dwim-shell-command--on-marked-files`.

# \[2022-07-09 Sat\] Emacs: Password-protect current pdf (revisited)
---
id: emacs-password-protect-current-pdf-revisited
---

UPDATE: [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) is now available on [melpa](https://melpa.org/#/dwim-shell-command).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-password-protect-current-pdf-revisited/passprotect.gif)

With a recent look at writing [DWIM shell commands](emacs-dwim-shell-command/), I've been revisiting my custom Emacs functions invoking command line utilities.

Take this [post](emacs-password-protect-current-pdf/), for example, where I invoke [qpdf](https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf) via a elisp. Using the new `dwim-shell-command--on-marked-files` in [dwim-shell-command.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command/blob/main/dwim-shell-command.el), the code is stripped down to a bare minimum:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-commands-pdf-password-protect ()
  "Password protect pdf."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   "Password protect pdf"
   (format "qpdf --verbose --encrypt '%s' '%s' 256 -- '<<f>>' '<<fne>>_enc.<<e>>'"
           (read-passwd "user-password: ")
           (read-passwd "owner-password: "))
   :utils "qpdf"
   :extensions "pdf"))
```

Compare the above `dwim-shell-command--on-marked-files` usage to my [previous implementation](emacs-password-protect-current-pdf/):

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun pdf-password-protect ()
  "Password protect current pdf in buffer or `dired' file."
  (interactive)
  (unless (executable-find "qpdf")
    (user-error "qpdf not installed"))
  (unless (equal "pdf"
                 (or (when (buffer-file-name)
                       (downcase (file-name-extension (buffer-file-name))))
                     (when (dired-get-filename nil t)
                       (downcase (file-name-extension (dired-get-filename nil t))))))
    (user-error "no pdf to act on"))
  (let* ((user-password (read-passwd "user-password: "))
         (owner-password (read-passwd "owner-password: "))
         (input (or (buffer-file-name)
                    (dired-get-filename nil t)))
         (output (concat (file-name-sans-extension input)
                         "_enc.pdf")))
    (message
     (string-trim
      (shell-command-to-string
       (format "qpdf --verbose --encrypt '%s' '%s' 256 -- '%s' '%s'"
               user-password owner-password input output))))))
```

This really changes things for me. I'll be more inclined to add more of these tiny integrations to lots of great command line utilities. Take this recent [Hacker News post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32028752) on [ocrmypdf](https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF) as an example. Their [cookbook](https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook.html) has lots of examples that can be easily used via `dwim-shell-command--on-marked-files`.

What command line utils would you use?

# \[2022-07-07 Thu\] Emacs DWIM shell-command
---
id: emacs-dwim-shell-command
---

UPDATE: [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) is now available on [melpa](https://melpa.org/#/dwim-shell-command).

I've [talked about DWIM before](emacs-dwim-do-what-i-mean/), where I bend Emacs to help me do what I mean. Emacs is also great for [wrapping command-line one-liners with elisp](emacs-password-protect-current-pdf/), so I can quickly invoke commands without thinking too much about flags, arguments, etc.

I keep thinking the [shell-command](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shell.html) is ripe for plenty of enhancements using our DWIM fairydust.

## Do what I mean how?

### Smart template instantiation

I've drawn inspiration from [dired-do-shell-command](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shell-Commands-in-Dired.html), which substitutes special characters like \* and ? with marked files. I'm also drawing inspiration from [org babel](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/)'s [noweb](https://orgmode.org/manual/Noweb-Reference-Syntax.html) syntax to substitute `<<f>>` (file path), `<<fne>>` (file path without extension), and `<<e>>` (extension). My initial preference was to use something like `$f`, `$fne`, and `$e`, but felt they clashed with shell variables.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-dwim-shell-command/template.png)

### Operate on dired marked files

This is DWIM, so if we're visiting a [dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html) buffer, the shell command should operate on all the marked files.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-dwim-shell-command/diredmark.gif)

### Operate on current buffer file

Similarly, if visiting a buffer with an associated file, operate on that file instead.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-dwim-shell-command/blur.png)

### Automatically take me to created files

Did the command create a new file in the current directory? Take me to it, right away.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-dwim-shell-command/showme.png)

### Show me output on error

I'm not usually interested in the command output when generating new files, unless there was an error of course. Offer to show it.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-dwim-shell-command/couldnt.png)

### Show me output if no new files

Not all commands generate new files, so automatically show me the output for these instances.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-dwim-shell-command/apple.gif)

### Make it easy to create utilities

[ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) is awesome, but man I can never remember all the flags and arguments. I may as well wrap commands like these in a convenient elisp function and invoke via [execute-extended-command](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/efaq/Extended-commands.html), or my favorite [counsel-M-x](http://oremacs.com/swiper/#minibuffer-key-bindings) (with completion), bound to the vital `M-x`.

All those gifs you see in this post were created with `dwim-shell-command-convert-to-gif`, powered by the same elisp magic.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-command-convert-to-gif ()
  "Convert all marked videos to optimized gif(s)."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command--on-marked-files
   "Convert to gif"
   "ffmpeg -loglevel quiet -stats -y -i <<f>> -pix_fmt rgb24 -r 15 <<fne>>.gif"
   :utils "ffmpeg"))
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-dwim-shell-command/togif_x1.5.gif)

This makes wrapping one-liners a breeze, so let's do some more…

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-command-convert-audio-to-mp3 ()
  "Convert all marked audio to mp3(s)."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   "Convert to mp3"
   "ffmpeg -stats -n -i '<<f>>' -acodec libmp3lame '<<fne>>.mp3'"
   :utils "ffmpeg"))

(defun dwim-shell-command-convert-image-to-jpg ()
  "Convert all marked images to jpg(s)."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   "Convert to jpg"
   "convert -verbose '<<f>>' '<<fne>>.jpg'"
   :utils "convert"))

(defun dwim-shell-command-drop-video-audio ()
  "Drop audio from all marked videos."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   "Drop audio" "ffmpeg -i '<<f>>' -c copy -an '<<fne>>_no_audio.<<e>>'"
   :utils "ffmpeg"))
```

### Make it spin ;)

Ok, not quite, but use Emacs's [progress-reporter](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Progress.html) just for kicks.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-dwim-shell-command/progress.gif)

## Use it everywhere

`dwim-shell-command` covers my needs (so far anyway), so I'm binding it to existing bindings.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(use-package dwim-shell-command
  :bind
  ("M-!" . dwim-shell-command))

(use-package dired
  :bind (:map dired-mode-map
              ([remap dired-do-async-shell-command] . dwim-shell-command)
              ([remap dired-do-shell-command] . dwim-shell-command)
              ([remap dired-smart-shell-command] . dwim-shell-command)))
```

## Bring those command line utilities

On the whole, this really changes things for me. I'll be more inclined to bring command line utilities to seamless Emacs usage. Take this recent [Hacker News post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32028752) on [ocrmypdf](https://github.com/ocrmypdf/OCRmyPDF) as an example. Their [cookbook](https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook.html) has lots of examples that can be easily used via `dwim-shell-command--on-marked-files`. What command line utilities would you bring?

## Where's the code?

UPDATE: [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command) is now available on [melpa](https://melpa.org/#/dwim-shell-command).

The code for [dwim-shell-command.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/ar/dwim-shell-command.el) is likely a bit rough still, but you can take a peek if interested. Keep in mind this is DWIM, tailored for what ✨I✨ mean. Some of the current behavior may not be your cup of tea, but this is Emacs. You can bend it to do what ✨you✨ mean. Happy Emacsing.

# \[2022-06-02 Thu\] Emacs: Password-protect current pdf
---
id: emacs-password-protect-current-pdf
---

UPDATE: Check out [Password-protect current pdf (revisted)](emacs-password-protect-current-pdf-revisited) for a simpler version.

Every so often, I need to password-protect a pdf. On macOS, [Preview has a simple solution](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/preview/prvw587dd90f/mac), but I figured there must be a command line utility to make this happen. There are options, but [qdf](https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf) did the job just fine.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
qpdf --verbose --encrypt USER-PASSWORD OWNER-PASSWORD KEY-LENGTH -- input.pdf output.pdf
```

So what does `qpdf` have to do with Emacs? Command-line utilities are easy to invoke from Emacs via `shell-command` (M-!), but I don't want to remember the command nor the parameters. I may as well add a function that [does what I mean](emacs-dwim-do-what-i-mean/) and password-protect either buffers or [dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html) files.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun pdf-password-protect ()
    "Password protect current pdf in buffer or `dired' file."
    (interactive)
    (unless (executable-find "qpdf")
      (user-error "qpdf not installed"))
    (unless (equal "pdf"
                   (or (when (buffer-file-name)
                         (downcase (file-name-extension (buffer-file-name))))
                       (when (dired-get-filename nil t)
                         (downcase (file-name-extension (dired-get-filename nil t))))))
      (user-error "no pdf to act on"))
    (let* ((user-password (read-passwd "user-password: "))
           (owner-password (read-passwd "owner-password: "))
           (input (or (buffer-file-name)

           (output (concat (file-name-sans-extension input)

id: plain-org-v14-released
---

[Plain Org](https://plainorg.com) v1.4 is now available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1578965002).

I was on a long flight recently 🦘, so I gave list and checkbox editing a little love. There's a couple of other minor improvements included.

If you haven't heard of [Plain Org](https://plainorg.com), it gives you access to [org](https://orgmode.org) files on iPhone while away from your beloved [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

I love org markup, but we (iPhone + org users) are a fairly niche bunch. If you're finding Plain Org useful, **please help support this effort** by getting the word out. Tell your friends, [tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Plain%20Org%20https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid1578965002%20), or blog about it.

On to v1.4 release notes…

## Improved list/checkbox editing

Adding list or checkbox items is traditionally cumbersome via the iPhone's keyboard. This release adds new toolbar actions and smart return to simplify things.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v14-released/list_this.gif)

## Render form feed characters

Form feed characters are now rendered within expanded headings.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v14-released/form_feed.jpg)

Note: There's a limitation. Form feed characters at the end of a heading aren't currently displayed.

## Other

Increased all button tap areas in edit toolbar. This should hopefully improve interaction.

On to v1.3 release notes…

## Toggle recurring tasks

You can now toggle recurring tasks with either catchup `<2022-04-15 Fri ++1d>`, restart `<2022-04-15 Fri .+1d>`, or cumulate `<2022-04-15 Fri +1d>` repeaters.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v130-released/recurring.gif)

## Log state transitions

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v130-released/logging.gif)

## Fullscreen view

The navigation bar now hides on scroll. This can be enabled/disabled via `View > Full Screen` menu.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v130-released/fullscreen.gif)

The previous screenshot text comes from [Org Mode - Organize Your Life In Plain Text](http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html), a magnificent org resource.

## Deadline and scheduled date rendered

In the past, `SCHEDULED` and `DEADLINE` were rendered (but only one of them at a time). Now both are rendered alongside each other (deadline has an orange tint).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v130-released/deadline_scheduled.png)

## Roundtripping fidelity

Many roundtripping fidelity improvements included in 1.3. Shoutout to [u/Oerm](https://www.reddit.com/user/Oerm/) who reported [unnecessary formatting changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/plainorg/comments/ty7onh/changing_todo_status_of_one_item_triggers/) in unmodified areas and helped test all fixes.

## Other bug fixes improvements

-   Disable raw text edit menu when file is not accessible.
-   Minor improvements to inline editing layouts (vertical height and drawers).
-   ABRT and HABIT now recognized as a popular keywords.
-   Improve state transition alignment to match org mode behaviour.
-   Fixes roundtripping state transition notes (leading to data loss).
-   Log creation from share sheet.
-   Increment DEADLINE **and** SCHEDULED, not just first found.
-   Roundtrip more whitespace in untouched areas.
-   Fixes org syntax inadvertently parsed within begin_src blocks (leading to data loss).

On to v1.2.1 release notes…

## Render LOGBOOK

State transitions and LOGBOOK drawers are now recognized and rendered as such.

Either of the following snippets are rendered as togglable LOGBOOK drawers.

``` org
* TODO Feed the fish
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2022-03-11 Fri 12:23]
```

``` org
* TODO Feed the cat
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2022-03-11 Fri 12:23]
:END:
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v121-released/logbook.jpg)

## Add task to top/bottom

Up until now, tasks were always appended to the bottom of things. This didn't work so well if you like seeing recent items bubbling up to the top.

This version adds a new setting: *Settings* \> *Add new tasks to* \> *Top/Bottom*, giving you the choice.

Note: Top is the new default value, please change this setting if you'd like to keep the previous behaviour.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v121-released/top_bottom.png)

## Checking for changes

Local file changes aren't always detected via [state change notifications](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocument/1619945-statechangednotification), so additional checks are now in place to offer reloading files.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v121-released/reload.jpg)

## Open inactive files

After adding new tasks via iOS's share sheet, if the item was added to a file other than the active one, offer to open that instead.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v121-released/load_other.jpg)

## Other improvements

-   Color keyword red/green depending on #+TODO: position.
-   Round-trip planning order (SCHEDULED, CLOSED, DEADLINE).
-   Improve tag alignment to match org mode behaviour (best effort, sorry).
-   Improve vertical spacing prior to lists.
-   Improve share sheet reliability.
-   Fix opening local links from list items.
-   Fix indent for list items without previous content.
-   Fix race condition in adding TITLE and ID to new files.
-   Fix incorrect keyword color selection in search toolbar.
-   Fix menu inadvertently closing.
-   Fix menu tapping for iPad.

# \[2022-03-26 Sat\] Emacs DWIM: swiper vs isearch vs phi-search
---
id: emacs-dwim-swiper-vs-isearch-vs-phi-search
---

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-dwim-swiper-vs-isearch-vs-phi-search/search-dwim.gif)

I've [talked about DWIM](emacs-dwim-do-what-i-mean/) in the past, that wonderful Emacs ability to [do what ✨I✨ mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM).

Emacs being hyper-configurable, we can always teach it more things, so it can do exactly what we mean.

There are no shortages of buffer searching packages for Emacs. I'm a fan of Oleh Krehel's [swiper](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper), but before that, I often relied on the built-in [isearch](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Basic-Isearch.html). Swiper is my default goto mechanism and have it bound to `C-s` (replacing the built-in [isearch-forward](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Basic-Isearch.html)).

Swiper services most needs until I start combining with other tools. Take [keyboard macros](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Keyboard-Macros.html) and [multiple cursors](https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el). Both wonderful, but neither can rely on swiper to do their thing. Ok, swiper does, but [in a different way](emacs-swiper-and-multiple-cursors/).

Rather than binding `C-s` to swiper, let's write a DWIM function that's aware of macros and multiple cursors. It must switch between swiper, isearch, and [phi-search](https://github.com/avkoval/phi-search) depending on what I want (search buffer, define macro, or search multiple cursors).

Let's also tweak swiper's behavior a little further and prepopulate its search term with the active region. Oh, and I also would like swiper to wrap around (see [ivy-wrap](http://oremacs.com/swiper/)). But only swiper, not other ivy utilities. I know, I'm picky, but that's the whole point of DWIM… so here's my function to search forward that does exactly what ✨I✨ mean:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun ar/swiper-isearch-dwim ()
  (interactive)
  ;; Are we using multiple cursors?
  (cond ((and (boundp 'multiple-cursors-mode)
              multiple-cursors-mode
              (fboundp  'phi-search))
         (call-interactively 'phi-search))
        ;; Are we defining a macro?
        (defining-kbd-macro
          (call-interactively 'isearch-forward))
        ;; Fall back to swiper.
        (t
         ;; Wrap around swiper results.
         (let ((ivy-wrap t))
           ;; If region is active, prepopulate swiper's search term.
           (if (and transient-mark-mode mark-active (not (eq (mark) (point))))
               (let ((region (buffer-substring-no-properties (mark) (point))))
                 (deactivate-mark)
                 (swiper-isearch region))
             (swiper-isearch))))))
```

The above snippet searches forward, but I'm feeling a little off-balance. Let's write an equivalent to search backwards. We can then bind it to `C-r`, also overriding the built-in [isearch-backward](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Basic-Isearch.html).

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun ar/swiper-isearch-backward-dwim ()
  (interactive)
  ;; Are we using multiple cursors?
  (cond ((and (boundp 'multiple-cursors-mode)
              multiple-cursors-mode
              (fboundp  'phi-search-backward))
         (call-interactively 'phi-search-backward))
        ;; Are we defining a macro?
        (defining-kbd-macro
          (call-interactively 'isearch-backward))
        ;; Fall back to swiper.
        (t
         ;; Wrap around swiper results.
         (let ((ivy-wrap t))
           ;; If region is active, prepopulate swiper's search term.
           (if (and transient-mark-mode mark-active (not (eq (mark) (point))))
               (let ((region (buffer-substring-no-properties (mark) (point))))
                 (deactivate-mark)
                 (swiper-isearch-backward region))
             (swiper-isearch-backward))))))
```

These may be on the hacky side of things, but hey… they do the job. If there are better/supported ways of accomplishing a similar thing, I'd love to [hear about it](https://twitter.com/xenodium).

# \[2022-03-12 Sat\] Grandma's vanilla pound cake
---
id: grandmas-vanilla-pound-cake
---

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/grandmas-vanilla-pound-cake/pound_cake.jpg)

My grandmother Hilda used to bake this for us grandkids. I don't know the origin of the recipe, but my parents, aunts, and cousins, they all bake it too. I'm a big fan, but only get to eat it when visiting. Yesterday, I changed that. Finally baked it myself ø/

## Ingredients

-   200g salted butter
-   2 cups (400 g) sugar
-   4 eggs
-   3 cups (375 g) plain flour
-   3 teaspoons baking powder
-   1 tablespoon (15 ml) vanilla extract
-   1 cup (250 ml) milk
-   2 tablespoons (30 ml) Málaga Virgen wine (port works too)

## Prep

-   Ensure all ingredients are at room temperature before you start.
-   Preheat oven at 175C.
-   Separate egg yolks and whites. Keep both.
-   Consolidate liquids into a bowl (milk + wine + vanilla).
-   Consolidate sifted powders into a bowl (flour + baking powder).

## Meringue

-   Beat egg whites into a snowy meringue. Set aside.

## Mixer

-   Beat butter in the mixer until creamy (important).
-   Add sugar and mix thoroughly ensuring creamy consistency remains (important).
-   Mix yolks in thoroughly one by one.
-   Mix in the meringue.
-   You're done with the mixer.

## Hand mixing

-   With a wooden spoon, alternate hand mixing the liquids and the powders. Start with liquids and end with powders.

## Pour into mould

-   Pour the mix into a non-stick baking mould.

## Bake

-   Bake in oven between 60 and 70 mins, but don’t be afraid to leave longer if needed. Mileage varies across ovens.
-   Use a cake tester after 60 minutes to decide how much longer to bake for (if needed).

# \[2022-03-05 Sat\] Emacs: viewing webp images
---
id: emacs-viewing-webp-images
---

There's a recent reddit post asking how to [view webp images in Emacs](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/t76isx/viewing_webp_images_in_emacs/). I didn't know the answer, but it's something I had wanted for some time. This post was a nice reminder to go and check things out. Was happy to [contribute an answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/t76isx/comment/hzft7ww/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Turns out, it's very simple. Just set `image-use-external-converter` and install relevant external tools.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(setq image-use-external-converter t)
```

I'm a `use-package` user, so I prefer to set with:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(use-package image
  :custom
  ;; Enable converting external formats (ie. webp) to internal ones.
  (image-use-external-converter t))
```

So what are the external tools needed? `C-h v` `image-use-external-converter` gives us the info we need:

> If non-nil, create-image will use external converters for exotic formats.
>
> Emacs handles most of the common image formats (SVG, JPEG, PNG, GIF and some others) internally, but images that don't have native support in Emacs can still be displayed if an external conversion program (like ImageMagick "convert", GraphicsMagick "gm" or "ffmpeg") is installed.
>
> This variable was added, or its default value changed, in Emacs 27.1.

I happen to be a macOS user, so I install ImageMagick with:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install imagemagick
```

---
id: emacs-fuzzy-search-apples-online-docs
---

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-fuzzy-search-apples-online-docs/color_search.gif)

When building software for the Apple ecosystem, Xcode is often the editor of choice. With [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) being my personal preference, I rarely find other iOS devs with a similar mindset.

When I saw [Mikael Konradsson](https://twitter.com/konrad1977)'s post describing [his Emacs Swift development setup](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/sndriv/i_finally_got_full_autocompetion_in_swift_with/), I reached out to say hello. While exchanging tips and tricks, the topic of searching Apple's docs came up. It had been a while since I looked into this, so it was a great reminder to revisit the space.

Back in June 2020, I wrote a snippet to [fuzzy search hackingwithswift.com](emacs-search-hackingwithswiftcom/), using Emacs's [ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) completion framework. With a similar online API, we could also search Apple's docs. Turns out, there is and we can we can use it to search [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/search) from our beloved editor.

# \[2022-02-13 Sun\] Plain Org v1.2 released
---
id: plain-org-v12-released
---

Although [Plain Org](https://plainorg.com) v1.2 has been in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1578965002) for a little while, the release write-up was overdue, sorry. The update receives some new features and bugfixes.

If you haven't heard of [Plain Org](https://plainorg.com), it gives ya access to your [org files](https://orgmode.org) on iOS while away from your beloved [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

If you're finding Plain Org useful, **please help support this effort** by getting the word out. Tell your friends, [tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Plain%20Org%20https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid1578965002%20), or blog about it.

Ok, now on to what's included in the v1.2 release…

## Edit heading sections inline

v1.0 introduced outline editing (for headings only). In v1.2, we can also edit section content. Press the `return` key multiple times to exit out section editing.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v12-released/inline.gif)

## Filter by keyword/priority/tag

From the search dialog, you can now filter by keyboard, priority, and tag.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v12-released/select_filter.png)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v12-released/filter_results.png)

## Render drawers and properties

Drawers are now rendered and can be expanded to view their content.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v12-released/drawer.gif)

## Open files via the Files app's "Share" sheet

From the Files app, you can now explicitly request launching files in Plain Org by using the "Share" menu.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v12-released/share.png)

## Render LaTeX src blocks (experimental)

This one has its rough edges at the moment, so have to mark it [experimental]{.underline}, but… you can can now render `#+begin_src latex` blocks.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v12-released/latex_src.png)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v12-released/latex_render.png)

## Insert title/id in new files

New files created via Plain Org automatically get `#+TITLE:` and `:ID:` inserted by default as follows:

``` org
#+TITLE: My favorite title
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       7C845D38-8D80-41B5-BEB1-94F673807355
:END:
```

*UPDATE*: Sorry, this feature currently has a bug. You may not get these values inserted into your new document. Working on a fix.

## Adding new tags quicker

Add tags quicker via the new + button.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v12-released/new_tag.png)

## Enable/disable sticky tags

Keywords, indent, and tags are maintained when adding new headings via outline editing. If you prefer disabling sticky tags, this can now be disabled.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v12-released/sticky_tags_setting.png)

## Improved navigation bar

v1.2 makes the navigation bar feel more at home on your iPhone. It uses a large title which scrolls into the navigation bar.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v12-released/navbar.gif)

## Bugfixes

-   Fix table rendering for iPad width.
-   Fix image's horizontal padding.
-   Fix adding new tags on new headings.
-   Fix snapshotting bug resulting in Syncthing conflicts.
-   Fix tapping menu after presenting other dialogs.
-   Filter out parenthesis in file-local keywords like `TODO(t)`.
-   Commit pending inline changes if search is requested.
-   Fix opening local links inside tables.
-   Roundtrip whitespace in empty headings.
-   Roundtrip trailing whitespace when raw-editing heading content.
-   Tapping on body content should not toggle expansion.

# \[2022-01-03 Mon\] Happy New Year and forming new habits
---
id: happy-new-year-and-forming-new-habits
---

Hacker News has a [summary of Atomic Habits](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29774859) (the [book](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits)). In my case, I really enjoyed reading the entire book. I liked its narrative, mixing [actionable]{.underline} and [concrete]{.underline} advice with personal stories and experiments.

After reading Atomic Habits during the first lockdown, I was excited to try out its actionables, specially tracking to keep me honest.

I tried a bunch of iOS apps, but wanted no friction, no tracking, no cloud, no social, no analytics, no account, etc. so eventually [built Flat Habits](frictionless-org-habits-on-ios/) ([flathabits.com](https://flathabits.com)). Also wanted to own my habit data (as plain text), so I made sure Flat Habits stored its data locally as an org file.

I'm an Emacs nutter and can say the strength in habit tracking lies in removing daily friction from the tracking process itself. A quickly accessible mobile app can really help with that. For me, Emacs plays a less important role here. The plain text part is cherry on top (bringing piece of mind around lock-in). In my case, it's been months since I looked at the plain text file itself from an Emacs org buffer. The iOS app, on the other hand, gets daily usage.

As for forming lasting habits (the actual goal here)… it's been well over a year since I started running as a regular form of exercise. While reading Atomic Habits really changed how I think of habits, a tracker played a crucial part in the daily grind. I happen to have built a tracker that [plays nice with Emacs](flat-habits-meets-org-agenda/).

It's a new year. If you're looking at forming new habits, you may want some inspiration and also practical and concrete guidance. The book Atomic Habits can help with that. You can decide on which apps and how to implement the tracking process later on. Pen and paper is also a viable option and there are plenty of templates you can download.

There's a surplus of habit-tracking apps on the app stores. I built yet another one for iOS, modeled after my needs.

# \[2021-12-12 Wed\] Plain Org v1.1 released 🎄☃️
---
id: plain-org-v11-released
---

[Plain Org](https://plainorg.com) v1.1 is now available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1578965002). The update receives new features and bugfixes.

If you're finding Plain Org useful, **please help support this effort** by getting the word out. Tell your friends, [tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Plain%20Org%20https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fid1578965002%20), or blog about it.

## What is Plain Org?

Ok, now on to what's included in the v1.1 release…

## Compact mode

By default, Plain Org layout uses generous padding. The new option `Menu -> View -> Compact mode` packs more content into your screen.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v11-released/compact.gif)

## Regroup active and inactive tasks

Regrouping tasks now bubbles active ones up. Similarly, inactive tasks drop to the bottom of their node. Changes are persisted to the org file.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v11-released/regroup.gif)

## Native table rendering

Tables are now rendered natively but also support displaying links and other formatting within cells.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v11-released/table.gif)

## Open local ID links

If your file provider supports granting access to folders, local ID links (ie. `id:eb155a82-92b2-4f25-a3c6-0304591af2f9`) can now be resolved and opened from Plain Org. Note that for ID links to resolve, other org files must live in either the same directory or a subdirectory.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v11-released/idlink.gif)

## Fill paragraphs

If your org paragraphs contain newlines optimizing for bigger screens, you can toggle `Menu -> View -> Fill paragraph` to optimize rendering for your iPhone. This rendering option makes no file modifications.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v11-released/fillparagraph.gif)

By the way, the previous screenshot text comes from [Org Mode - Organize Your Life In Plain Text](http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html), a magnificent org resource.

## Show/hide basic scheduling

Use the new `Menu -> View -> Scheduling` to toggle showing `SCHEDULED` or `DEADLINE` dates.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v11-released/scheduling.gif)

## Show/hide tags

Similarly, the new `Menu -> View -> Tags` option toggles displaying tags.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v11-released/hidetags.gif)

## Native list rendering

Lists are now rendered natively. With the exception of numbered cases, list items now share a common bullet icon. Description lists are also recognized and receive additional formatting when rendered.

``` org
- First list item
* Second list item
+ Third list item
1. Numbered list item
+ Term :: Description for term
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v11-released/listitems.png)

Numbered checkboxes are now recognized and receive the same formatting and interaction as their non-numbered counterparts.

``` org
1. [ ] First checkbox
2. [X] Second checkbox
3. [X] Third checkbox
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-v11-released/numbered.png)

## Reload current file

Plain Org may not be able to automatically reload files for some syncing providers. In those instances, use `Menu -> Reload` to explicitly request a reload.

## Open .txt files

Although .org files are plain text files, they aren't always recognized by other text-editing apps. This release enables opening .txt files, so you can choose to render them in Plain Org, while giving you the option to edit elsewhere.

## Bugfixes

-   Improve vertical whitespace handling.
-   Fixes rendering edge cases.
-   Fail gracefully when creating new files on unsupported cloud providers.
-   Prevent creating new files with redundant extensions.
-   File access improvements.
-   Replicates property spacing behaviour using Emacs's `org-property-format` default value.
-   Fixes keyword picker border rendering.
-   Improves rendering performance for large nodes.

# \[2021-11-28 Sun\] Emacs bends again
---
id: emacs-bends-again
---

While adding more rendering capabilities to [Plain Org](https://plainorg.com), it soon became apparent some sort of screenshot/snapshot testing was necessary to prevent regressing existing features. That is, we first generate a rendered snapshot from a given org snippet, followed by some visual inspection, right before we go and save the blessed snapshot (often referred to as golden) to our project. Future changes are validated against the golden snapshot to ensure rendering is still behaving as expected.

Let's say we'd like to validate table rendering with links, we can write a test as follows:

``` swift
func testTableWithLinks() throws {
  assertSnapshot(
    matching: OrgMarkupText.make(
      """
      | URL                    | Org link    |
      |------------------------+-------------|
      | https://flathabits.com | [[https://flathabits.com][Flat Habits]] |
      | Regular text           | Here too    |
      |------------------------+-------------|
      """),
    as: .image(layout: .sizeThatFits))
}
```

The corresponding snapshot golden can be seen below.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-bends-again/testTableWithLinks.1.png)

This is all done rather effortlessly thanks to [Point Free](https://twitter.com/pointfreeco)'s wonderful [swift-snapshot-testing](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing) utilities.

So what does any of this have to do with Emacs? You see, as I added more snapshot tests and made modifications to the rendering logic, I needed a quick way to visually inspect and override all goldens. All the main pieces were already there, I just needed some elisp glue to *bend Emacs my way™.*

First, I needed to run my Xcode builds from the command line. This is already [supported via xcodebuild](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2339/_index.html). Next, I needed a way to parse test execution data to extract failing tests. [David House](https://twitter.com/davidahouse)'s [xcodebuild-to-json](https://github.com/davidahouse/xcodebuild-to-json) handles this perfectly. What's left? Glue it all up with some elisp.

Beware, the following code snippet is packed with assumptions about my project, it's messy, surely has bugs, can be optimized, etc. But the important point here is that Emacs is such an amazing malleable power tool. Throw some elisp at it and you can to bend it to your liking. After all, it's [your]{.underline} editor.

And so here we are, I can now run snapshot tests from Emacs using my hacked up `plainorg-snapshot-test-all` function and quickly override (or ignore) all newly generated snapshots by merely pressing y/n keys. Oh, and our beloved web browser was also invited to the party. Press "d" to open two browser tabs if you'd like to take a closer look (not demoed below).

Success. *Emacs bends again*.

# \[2021-11-10 Wed\] Plain Org has joined the chat (iOS)
---
id: plain-org-has-joined-the-chat

The App Store is a crowded space when it come to markdown apps. A quick search yields a wonderful wealth of choice. Kinda overwhelming, but a great problem to have nonetheless.

For those of us with org as our markup of choice, the App Store is far less crowded. I wish we could fill more than a screen's worth of search results, so you know… I could show you another pretty gif scrolling through org results. For now, we'll settle on a single frame showcasing our 4 org options.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-has-joined-the-chat/store-side-comparison-mid.gif)

[Beorg](https://beorg.app/), [MobileOrg](http://mobileorg.github.io/), [Flat Habits](https://flathabits.com/), and [Orgro](https://orgro.org/) are all great options. Each with strengths of their own. [Organice](https://organice.200ok.ch/), while not on the App Store, is another option for those looking for a web alternative. Of these, I had already authored one of them. More on that in a sec… You see, about a year ago I wanted to play with Swift, SPM, and lsp itself. Also, having Swift code completion in Emacs via [lsp-sourcekit](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-sourcekit) sounded like a fun thing to try out, so I started using it while writing a Swift org parser.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-has-joined-the-chat/magit.png)

While working on the parser, I happened to be reading [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) (awesome book btw)… It was also a great time to play around with SwiftUI, which by the way, is pretty awesome too. With Atomic Habits fresh in mind, org parser in one hand, and SwiftUI in the other, I built [Flat Habits](https://flathabits.com): a lightweight habit tracker powered by org.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/frictionless-org-habits-on-ios/flat_habits.gif)

I love being able to save habit data to plain text and easily track on my iPhone (via Flat Habits) or laptop (via Emacs). I wanted to [extend similar convenience to org tasks](org-habits-on-ios-check-tasks-youre-next/), so I built [Plain Org](https://plainorg.com).

My previous [post](org-habits-on-ios-check-tasks-youre-next/) mentioned *quickly adding new tasks and searching existing ones* as Plain Org's driving goals. Of course, neither of those are as useful without automatic cloud syncing, so pluging into [iOS's third party cloud support](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT206481#thirdparty) was a must-have.

With these baseline features in place, I [started an alpha/beta group](https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/comments/p5bonn/ios_plain_org_alpha_builds_now_on_testflight_dm/) via [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/). Early Plain Org adopters have been wonderfully supportive, given lots of great feedback, and helped shape the initial feature set you see below.

*There's plenty more that can be supported, but hey let's get v1 out the door. Gotta start somewhere.*

## Plain Org v1 features

-   View and edit your org mode tasks while on the go.
-   Beautifully rendered org markup.
-   Sync your org files using your favorite cloud provider.
-   Create new files.
-   Outline-style editing with toolbar
    -   Keywords
    -   Indent
    -   Priority
    -   Tags
    -   Formatting: bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, verbatim, and code.
-   Add links from Safari via share extension.
-   Add new tasks via Spotlight.
-   Reorder headings via drag/drop.
-   Checkboxes
    -   Interactive toggling.
    -   Quickly reset multiple checkboxes.
-   Follow local links.
-   Show inline images.
-   File-local keywords and visibility.
-   Filter open/closed tasks.
-   Show/hide stars.
-   Edit raw text.
-   Light/dark mode.

## Plain Org joins the chat

Today Plain Org joins the likes of [Beorg](https://beorg.app/), [MobileOrg](http://mobileorg.github.io/), [Flat Habits](https://flathabits.com/), and [Orgro](https://orgro.org/) on the App Store.

# \[2021-09-19 Sun\] Plain Org for iOS (a month later)
---
id: plain-org-for-ios-a-month-later
---

A month ago, I posted about my desire to [bring org tasks/TODOs to iOS](org-habits-on-ios-check-tasks-youre-next/) and make them quickly available from my iPhone.

Since then, I've received some great feedback, which I've been slowly chipping away at. My intent isn't so much to move my org workflow over to iOS, but to supplement Emacs while away from my laptop.

As of now, this is what the inline edit experience looks like:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-for-ios-a-month-later/inline_keyword_toolbar.gif)

If, like me, you prefer dark mode. The app's got ya covered:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plain-org-for-ios-a-month-later/dark.png)

*Plain Org* is not yet available on the App Store, but you can get a TestFlight invite if you send me an email address. Ping me on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/xenodium), [twitter](https://twitter.com/xenodium), or email me at "plainorg" + "@" + "xenodium.com".

You can also check out progress over at the [r/plainorg](https://www.reddit.com/r/plainorg/) subreddit.

# \[2021-08-19 Thu\] Org habits on iOS? Check! Tasks, you're next
---
id: org-habits-on-ios-check-tasks-youre-next

I'm an [org mode](https://orgmode.org) fan. This blog is powered by org. It's more of an accidental blog that started as a [single org file](https://github.com/xenodium/xenodium.github.io/blob/master/index.org) keeping notes. I use [org babel](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html) too. Oh and [org habits](https://orgmode.org/manual/Tracking-your-habits.html). My never-ending list of TODOs is also powered by org. I manage all of this from Emacs and peek at TODOs using [org agenda](https://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-Views.html). This all works really well while I'm sitting in front of my laptop running Emacs.

But then I'm away from my laptop… and I need to quickly record habits on the go. I need it to be low-friction. Ssh'ing to an Emacs instance from a smartphone isn't an option. I'm an iPhone user, so whatever the solution, it should play nice with Emacs and org mode. I built [Flat Habits](https://flathabits.com) for habit tracking and I'm fairly happy with the result. As of today, my longest-tracked habit is on a 452-day streak.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/frictionless-org-habits-on-ios/flat_habits.gif)

Moving on to org tasks/TODOs… I want something fairly frictionless while on the go. With *Flat Habits* as a stepping stone, I can now reuse some parts to build [Plain Org](https://reddit.com/r/plainorg). This new app should give me quick access to my tasks. The two driving goals are: quickly add new tasks and search existing ones while away from my laptop. Ok, maybe basic editing helps too. Oh and it should sync over cloud, of course.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/org-habits-on-ios-check-tasks-youre-next/plainorgdemo.gif)

I now have an early implementation of sorts, [available on TestFlight](https://www.reddit.com/r/plainorg/comments/p5bnji/ios_more_improvements_alpha_builds_now_on/). If you'd like to give it a try, *send me an email address* to receive the the invite. Ping me on [reddit](https://reddit.com/u/xenodium), [twitter](https://twitter.com/xenodium), or email me at "plainorg" + "@" + "xenodium.com".

# \[2021-07-11 Sun\] Flat Habits 1.1 released
---
id: flat-habits-11-released
---

[Flat Habits](https://flathabits.com/) 1.1 is now available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1558358855). Flat Habits is a habit tracker that’s mindful of your time, data, and privacy. It's powered by [org](https://orgmode.org) plain text markup, enabling you to use your [favorite editor](frictionless-org-habits-on-ios/) (Emacs, Vim, VSCode, etc.) to poke at your habit data.

## What's new?

This release implements a few of features requested by users.

## Multiday weekly habits

This is the chunkiest addition and most requested feature. You can now select multiple days when scheduling weekly habits.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/flat-habits-11-released/multi_day_creation.gif)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/flat-habits-11-released/multi_day_calendar.png)

## Historical management

Sometimes you forget to mark a habit done or make a mistake toggling one. Either way, you can now toggle any habit day from the calendar/streak view.

### Long tap

Long tap shows you the editing option available for that day.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/flat-habits-11-released/long_tap.gif)

### Short tap

Short tap typically toggles between "Done" and "Not done".

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/flat-habits-11-released/short_tap.gif)

## Where's today?

A few folks rightfully asked for today's date to be highlighted in the calendar view, and so we now have a red circle.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/flat-habits-11-released/today.png)

## Improved error messages

Hopefully you don't run into issues, but if you do, I hope the app helps ya sort them out.

## Bugfixes

-   Tapping on blur now dismisses habit edit dialog.
-   Future habits now longer editable.
-   Skipped habits no longer have a default tap action.
-   Undoing from streak/calendar view now refreshes correctly.
-   Undoing habit addition on iPad removes streak/calendar view.

# \[2021-07-11 Sun\] macOS: Show in Finder / Show in Emacs
---
id: show-in-finder--show-in-emacs
---

From Christian Tietze's [Open macOS Finder Window in Emacs Dired](https://christiantietze.de/posts/2021/07/open-finder-window-in-dired/), I learned about [reveal-in-osx-finder](https://github.com/kaz-yos/reveal-in-osx-finder). This is handy for the few times I want to transition from Emacs to Finder for file management. I say few times since Emacs's directory editor, [dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html), is just awesome. I've written about dired customizations [here](showhide-emacs-dired-details-in-style/) and [here](showhide-emacs-dired-details-in-style/), but since dired is *just another buffer,* you can apply your Emacs magic like multiple cursors to [batch rename files in an editable dired buffer](batch-renaming-with-counsel-find-dired-and-wdired/).

To transition from macOS Finder to Emacs, Christian offers an Emacs interactive command that fetches Finder's location and opens a dired buffer via AppleScript. On a similar note, I learned from redditor [u/pndc](https://www.reddit.com/user/pndc/) that [Finder's proxy icons can be dragged over to Emacs](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ohgz0s/open_macos_finder_windows_path_in_dired/h4p8a8f?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), which handily drops ya into a dired buffer.

With these two solutions in mind, I looked into a third one to offer a context menu option in Finder to show the file in Emacs. This turned out to be fairly easy using Automator, which I've rarely used.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/show-in-finder--show-in-emacs/show_in_emacs.gif)

I created a flow that runs a shell script to "Show in Emacs", revealing the selected file or folder in an dired buffer. This is similar to Christian's solution, but invoked from Finder itself. The flow also uses *dired-goto-file* which moves the point (cursor) to the file listed under dired.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/show-in-finder--show-in-emacs/show_in_emacs.png)

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
current_dir=$(dirname "$1")
osascript -e 'tell application "Emacs" to activate'
path/to/emacsclient --eval "(progn (dired \"$current_dir\") (dired-goto-file \"$1\"))"
```

As a bonus, I added an "Open in Emacs" option, which does as it says on the tin. Rather than show the file listed in a dired buffer, it gets Emacs to open it in your favorite major mode. This option is not technically needed since Finder already provides an "Open With" context menu, but it does remove a few click here and there.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/show-in-finder--show-in-emacs/open_in_emacs.png)

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
osascript -e 'tell application "Emacs" to activate'
/Users/alvaro/homebrew/bin/emacsclient --eval "(find-file \"$1\")"
```

On a side note, Emacs defaults to creating new frames when opening files via "Open With" menu (or "open -a Emacs foo.txt"). I prefer to use my existing Emacs frame, which can be accomplished by setting ns-pop-up-frames to nil.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(setq ns-pop-up-frames nil)
```

# \[2021-06-27 Sun\] Emacs: smarter search and replace
---
id: emacs-smarter-search-and-replace
---

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-smarter-search-and-replace/smarter_replace.gif)

Not long ago, I made a note to go back and read [Mac for Translators](https://mac4translators.blogspot.com)'s [Emacs regex with Emacs lisp](https://mac4translators.blogspot.com/2021/06/regex-with-elisp.html) post. The author highlights Emacs's ability to apply additional logic when replacing text during a search-and-replace session. It does so by leveraging elisp expressions.

Coincidentally, a redditor recently asked [What is the simplest way to apply a math formula to all numbers in a buffer/region?](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/o878am/what_is_the_simplest_way_to_apply_a_math_formula/) Some of the answers also point to *search and replace* leveraging elisp expressions.

While I rarely need to apply additional logic when replacing matches, it's nice to know we have options available in our Emacs toolbox. This prompted me to check out [replace-regexp](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/b8f9e58ef72402e69a1f0960816184d52e5d2d29/lisp/replace.el#L709)'s documentation (via M-x [describe-function](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Name-Help.html) or my favorite M-x [helpful-callable](https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful)). There's lots in there. Go check its docs out. You may be pleasantly surprised by all the features packed under this humble function.

For instance, \\& expands to the current match. Similarly, \\#& expands to the current match, fed through [string-to-number](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/String-Conversion.html). But what if you'd like to feed the match to another function? You can use \\, to signal evaluation of an elisp expression. In other words, you could multiply by 3 using \\,(\* 3 \\#&) or inserting whether a number is odd or even with something like \\,(if (oddp \\#&) "(odd)" "(even)").

Take the following text:

``` example
1
2
3
4
5
6
```

We can label each value "(odd)" or "(even)" as well as multiply by 3, by invoking *replace-regexp* as follows:

> M-x replace-regexp

\[PCRE\] Replace regex:

> \[-0-9.\]+

Replace regex \[-0-9.\]+:

> \\& \\,(if (oddp \\#&) "(odd)" "(even)") x 3 = \\,(\* 3 \\#&)

``` example
1 (odd) x 3 = 3
2 (even) x 3 = 6
3 (odd) x 3 = 9
4 (even) x 3 = 12
5 (odd) x 3 = 15
6 (even) x 3 = 18
```

It's worth noting that *replace-regexp*'s cousin [query-replace-regexp](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Query-Replace.html) also handles all this wonderful magic.

Happy searching and replacing!

Back in May 2020, I shared a snippet to extend [ob-swift](https://github.com/zweifisch/ob-swift) to [preview SwiftUI layouts using Emacs org blocks](swiftui-layout-previews-using-emacs-org-blocks/).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/swiftui-layout-previews-using-emacs-org-blocks/ob-swiftui.gif)

When I say extend, I didn't quite modify ob-swift itself, but rather [advised](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Advising-Functions.html) [org-babel-execute:swift](https://github.com/zweifisch/ob-swift/blob/ed478ddbbe41ce5373efde06b4dd0c3663c9055f/ob-swift.el#L37) to modify its behavior at runtime.

Fast-forward to June 2021 and Scott Nicholes [reminded me there's still interest](https://github.com/zweifisch/ob-swift/issues/4#issuecomment-858196354) in org babel SwiftUI support. ob-swift [seems a little inactive](https://github.com/zweifisch/ob-swift/commits/master), but no worries there. The package offers great general-purpose Swift support. On the other hand, SwiftUI previews can likely live as a single-purpose package all on its own… and so I set off to bundle the rendering functionality into a new [ob-swiftui](https://github.com/xenodium/ob-swiftui) package.

Luckily, org babel's documentation has a straightforward section to help you [develop support for new babel languages](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/index.html). They simplified things by offering [template.el](https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/worg/raw/master/org-contrib/babel/ob-template.el), which serves as the foundation for your language implementation. For the most part, it's a matter of searching, replacing strings, and removing the bits you don't need.

The elisp core of ob-swiftui is fairly simple. It expands the org block body, inserts the expanded body into a temporary buffer, and finally feeds the code to the Swift toolchain for execution.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(defun org-babel-execute:swiftui (body params)
  "Execute a block of SwiftUI code in BODY with org-babel header PARAMS.
This function is called by `org-babel-execute-src-block'"
  (message "executing SwiftUI source code block")
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert (ob-swiftui--expand-body body params))
    (shell-command-on-region
     (point-min)
     (point-max)
     "swift -" nil 't)
    (buffer-string)))
```

The expansion in *ob-swiftui–expand-body* is a little more interesting. It decorates the block's body, so it can become a fully functional and stand-alone SwiftUI macOS app. If you're familiar with Swift and SwiftUI, the code should be fairly self-explanatory.

From an org babel's perspective, the expanded code is executed whenever we press *C-c C-c* (or M-x [org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c](https://orgmode.org/manual/The-Very-Busy-C_002dc-C_002dc-Key.html#The-Very-Busy-C_002dc-C_002dc-Key)) within the block itself.

It's worthing mentioning that our new implementation supports two babel [header arguments](https://www.orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/header-args.html) (results and view). Both extracted from params using [map-elt](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/3af9e84ff59811734dcbb5d55e04e1fdb7051e77/lisp/emacs-lisp/map.el#L106) and replaced in the expanded Swift code to enable/disable snapshotting or explicitly setting a SwiftUI root view.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(defun ob-swiftui--expand-body (body params)
  "Expand BODY according to PARAMS and PROCESSED-PARAMS, return the expanded body."
  (let ((write-to-file (member "file" (map-elt params :result-params)))
        (root-view (when (and (map-elt params :view)
                              (not (string-equal (map-elt params :view) "none")))
                     (map-elt params :view))))
    (format
     "

       (format "NSApplication.shared.run {%s}" body))
     (if root-view
         body
       ""))))
```

For rendering inline SwiftUI previews in Emacs, we rely on NSView's [bitmapImageRepForCachingDisplay](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsview/1483440-bitmapimagerepforcachingdisplay) to capture an image snapshot. We write its output to a temporary file and piggyback-ride off org babel's *:results file* header argument to automatically render the image inline.

Here's ob-swiftui inline rendering in action:

When rendering SwiftUI externally, we're effectively running and interacting with the generated macOS app itself.

The two snippets give a general sense of what's needed to enable org babel to handle SwiftUI source blocks. Having said that, the full source and setup instructions are both available on [github](https://github.com/xenodium/ob-swiftui).

[ob-swiftui](https://github.com/xenodium/ob-swiftui) is now available on [melpa](https://melpa.org/#/ob-swiftui).

I recently [tweeted](https://twitter.com/xenodium/status/1404746233860837378) that Vivek Haldar's [10-year old post](https://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/3996068979/the-levels-of-emacs-proficiency) rings true today just the same. He writes about [the levels of Emacs proficiency](https://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/3996068979/the-levels-of-emacs-proficiency). All 6 levels are insightful in their own right, but for the sake of this post, let's quote an extract from level *4. Shell inside Emacs*:

> "And then, you learned about it: M-x shell.
>
> It was all just text. Why did you need another application for it? Why should only the shell prompt be editable? Why can’t I move my cursor up a few lines to where the last command spewed out its results? All these problems simply disappear when your shell (or shells) simply becomes another Emacs buffer, upon which all of the text manipulation power of Emacs can be brought to bear."

In other words, we aren't merely removing shell restrictions, but opening up possibilities…

Take Emacs eshell looping, for example. I use it so infrequently, I could never remember eshell's syntax. I would refer back to EmacsWiki's [Eshell For Loop](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EshellForLoop) or Mastering Emacs's [Mastering Eshell](https://masteringemacs.org/article/complete-guide-mastering-eshell) comments for a reminder. It finally dawned on me. I don't need to internalize this eshell syntax. I have [YASnippet](https://github.com/joaotavora/YASnippet) available like any other buffer. I could just type "for" and let YASnippet do the rest for me.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/yasnippet-in-emacs-eshell/yas-for.gif)

All I need is a tiny YASnippet:

``` YASnippet
#name : Eshell for loop
#key : for
# --
for f in ${1:*} { ${2:echo} "$f"; $3} $0
```

Want a gentle and succinct YASnippet intro? Check out Jake's [YASnippet introduction video](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/o282fq/YASnippet_snippetstemplating_introductiontutorial/).

If you're a [shell-mode](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shell-Mode.html) user, YASnippet would have you covered in your favorite shell. The expansion snippet can be modified to a Bash equivalent, giving us the same benefit. We type "for" and let YASnippet expand and hop over arguments. Here's a Bash equivalent emphasizing the hopping a little more:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/yasnippet-in-emacs-eshell/yasbash.gif)

``` YASnippet
#name : bash for loop
#key : for
# --
for f in ${1:*}; do ${2:echo} $f; done $0
```

ps. Looks like [vterm](https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm), [term](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Term-Mode.html), or [ansi-term](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AnsiTerm) work too. See Shane Mulligan's post: [Use YASnippets in term and vterm in emacs](https://mullikine.github.io/posts/use-yasnippets-in-term/).

# \[2021-06-16 Wed\] xcodebuild's SPM support (Xcode 11)
---
id: xcodebuilds-spm-support-xcode-11
---

Had been a while since I looked into generating Xcode projects from a Swift package. On my latest use of the *generate-xcodeproj* subcommand, I was greeted by a nice ~~warning~~ surprise…

``` {.bash results="output"}
swift package generate-xcodeproj
```

Xcode can handle Swift packages directly. Similarly, xcodebuild can handle them too. This isn't new. It's likely been available since Xcode 11. I just totally missed it.

*Note: I've yet to dig into Xcode 13 beta, as Swift packages may already support the build/test features I was after in xcodebuild (like [build/test on Catalyst](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/supportedplatform/3788290-maccatalyst)).*

In any case, on to xcodebuild… but let's first create a brand new Swift package.

## Creating a Swift package library

``` {.bash results="output"}
mkdir FooBar && cd FooBar
swift package init --type library
```

## List package schemes

We can use xcodebuild to list the available schemes.

``` {.bash results="output"}
xcodebuild -list
```

## Show supported platform, architecture, etc

Similarly, we can list destinations supported for the schemes.

``` {.bash results="output"}
xcodebuild -showdestinations -scheme FooBar
```

## macOS builds

Let's build for macOS, though let's first import UIKit into FooBar.swift. This ensures we get an expected failure when building for macOS.

``` swift
import UIKit

struct FooBar {
  var text = "Hello, World!"
}
```

Now let's attempt to build it…

``` {.bash results="verbatim"}
xcodebuild build -quiet -scheme FooBar -destination 'platform=macOS'
```

The failure expected as UIKit isn't available on your typical macOS builds.

## macOS Catalyst builds

We do, however, have Catalyst available, so we can use its variant to build for macOS with UIKit support, and.. voilà!

``` {.bash results="verbatim"}
xcodebuild build -quiet -scheme FooBar -destination 'platform=macOS,variant=Mac Catalyst' && echo \\o/
```

# \[2021-06-01 Tue\] Emacs DWIM: do what ✨I✨ mean
---
id: emacs-dwim-do-what-i-mean
---

Update: There's a DWIM [follow-up for searching](emacs-dwim-swiper-vs-isearch-vs-phi-search/).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-dwim-do-what-i-mean/do-what-i-mean.gif)

I was a rather puzzled the first time I spotted DWIM in an Emacs interactive command name. Don't think I remember what the command itself was, but what's important here is that [DWIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM) stands for [do what I mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM).

I love DWIM interactive commands. They enable commands to be smarter and thus pack more functionality, without incurring the typical cognitive overhead associated with remembering multiple commands (or key bindings). The Emacs manual does a great job describing DWIM for the [comment-dwim](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Comment-Commands.html) command:

    The word “dwim” is an acronym for “Do What I Mean”; it indicates that this command can be used for many different jobs relating to comments, depending on the situation where you use it.

It's really great to find built-in DWIM-powered Emacs commands. Third-party packages often include them too. I typically gravitate towards these commands and bind them in my Emacs config. Examples being upcase-dwim, downcase-dwim, or mc/mark-all-dwim.

But what if the DWIM command doesn't exist or the author has written a command for what *they* mean? This is your editor, so you can make it do what *you* mean.

Take for example, [org-insert-link](https://orgmode.org/manual/Handling-Links.html), bound to *C-c C-l* by default. It's handy for inserting [org mode links](https://orgmode.org/guide/Hyperlinks.html). I used it so frequently that I quickly internalized its key binding. Having said that, I often found myself doing some lightweight preprocessing prior to invoking *org-insert-link*. What if I can *make org-insert-link do what I mean*?

## What do I mean?

### Use URLs when in clipboard

If the URL is already in the clipboard, don't ask me for it. Just use it.

### Use the region too

If I have a region selected and there's a URL in the clipboard, just sort it out without user interaction.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-dwim-do-what-i-mean/link-this-text.gif)

### Automatically fetch titles

Automatically fetch URL titles from their HTML tag, but ask me for tweaks before insertion.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-dwim-do-what-i-mean/do-what-i-mean.gif)

### Fallback to org-insert-link

If my DWIM rules don't apply, fall back to using good ol' [org-insert-link](https://orgmode.org/manual/Handling-Links.html).

My most common use case here is when editing an existing link where I don't want neither its title nor URL automatically handled.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-dwim-do-what-i-mean/edit-link.gif)

## The code

This is your own DWIM command that does what *you* mean. Strive to write a clean implementation, but hey you can be forgiven for not handling all the cases that other folks *may* want or inlining more code than usual. The goal is to bend your editor a little, not write an Emacs package.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(defun ar/org-insert-link-dwim ()
  "Like `org-insert-link' but with personal dwim preferences."
  (interactive)
  (let* ((point-in-link (org-in-regexp org-link-any-re 1))
         (clipboard-url (when (string-match-p "^http" (current-kill 0))
                          (current-kill 0)))
         (region-content (when (region-active-p)
                           (buffer-substring-no-properties (region-beginning)
                                                           (region-end)))))
    (cond ((and region-content clipboard-url (not point-in-link))
           (delete-region (region-beginning) (region-end))
           (insert (org-make-link-string clipboard-url region-content)))
          ((and clipboard-url (not point-in-link))
           (insert (org-make-link-string
                    clipboard-url
                    (read-string "title: "
                                 (with-current-buffer (url-retrieve-synchronously clipboard-url)
                                   (dom-text (car
                                              (dom-by-tag (libxml-parse-html-region
                                                           (point-min)
                                                           (point-max))
                                                          'title))))))))
          (t
           (call-interactively 'org-insert-link)))))
```

## Org web tools package

I showed how to write your own DWIM command, so you can make Emacs do what ✨you✨ mean. *ar/org-insert-link-dwim* was built for my particular needs.

Having said all of this, alphapapa has built a great package with helpers for the org web/link space. It doesn't do what I mean (for now anyway), but it may work for you: [org-web-tools: View, capture, and archive Web pages in Org-mode](https://github.com/alphapapa/org-web-tools)[^2].

# \[2021-05-28 Fri\] Emacs link scraping (2021 edition)
---
id: emacs-link-scraping-2021-edition
---

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-link-scraping-2021-edition/scrape.png)

A recent Hacker News post, [Ask HN: Favorite Blogs by Individuals](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27302195), led me to dust off my oldie but trusty [command to extract comment links](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/92ef8259f016cdd4f67caf0e520096f6da4f7a18/emacs/ar/ar-url.el#L42). I use it to dissect these wonderful references more effectively.

You see, I wrote this command [back in 2015](get-emacs-to-gather-links-in-posts/). We can likely revisit and improve. The [enlive](https://github.com/zweifisch/enlive) package continues to do a fine job [fetching](https://github.com/zweifisch/enlive/blob/604a8ca272b6889f114e2b5a13adb5b1dc4bae86/enlive.el#L39), parsing, and [querying](https://github.com/zweifisch/enlive/blob/604a8ca272b6889f114e2b5a13adb5b1dc4bae86/enlive.el#L142) HTML. Let's improve my code instead… we can shed a few redundant bits and maybe use [newer libraries and features](modern-elisp-libraries/).

Most importantly, let's improve the user experience by sanitizing and filtering URLs a little better.

We start by writing a function that looks for a URL in the clipboard and subsequently fetches, parses, and extracts all links found in the target page.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(require 'enlive)
(require 'seq)

(defun ar/scrape-links-from-clipboard-url ()
  "Scrape links from clipboard URL and return as a list. Fails if no URL in clipboard."
  (unless (string-prefix-p "http" (current-kill 0))
    (user-error "no URL in clipboard"))
  (thread-last (enlive-query-all (enlive-fetch (current-kill 0)) [a])
    (mapcar (lambda (element)
              (string-remove-suffix "/" (enlive-attr element 'href))))
    (seq-filter (lambda (link)
                  (string-prefix-p "http" link)))
    (seq-uniq)
    (seq-sort (lambda (l1 l2)
                (string-lessp (replace-regexp-in-string "^http\\(s\\)*://" "" l1)
                              (replace-regexp-in-string "^http\\(s\\)*://" "" l2))))))
```

Let's chat *(current-kill 0)* for a sec. No improvement from my previous usage, but let's just say building interactive commands that work with your current clipboard (or [kill ring](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Kill-Ring.html) in Emacs terminology) is super handy (see [clone git repo from clipboard](emacs-clone-git-repo-from-clipboard/)).

Moving on to sanitizing and filtering URLs… Links often have trailing slashes. Let's flush them. [string-remove-suffix](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/3af9e84ff59811734dcbb5d55e04e1fdb7051e77/lisp/emacs-lisp/subr-x.el#L261) to the rescue. This and other handy string-manipulating functions are built into Emacs since 24.4 as part of [subr-x.el](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/emacs-lisp/subr-x.el).

Next, we can keep http(s) links and ditch everything else. The end-goal is to extract links posted by users, so these are typically fully qualified external URLs. [seq-filter](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/3af9e84ff59811734dcbb5d55e04e1fdb7051e77/lisp/emacs-lisp/seq.el) steps up to the task, included in Emacs since 25.1 as part of the [seq.el family](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/emacs-lisp/seq.el). We remove duplicate links using [seq-uniq](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/3af9e84ff59811734dcbb5d55e04e1fdb7051e77/lisp/emacs-lisp/seq.el#L431) and sort them via [seq-sort](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/3af9e84ff59811734dcbb5d55e04e1fdb7051e77/lisp/emacs-lisp/seq.el#L255). All part of the same package.

When sorting, we could straight up use *seq-sort* and *string-lessp* and nothing else, but it would separate http and https links. Let's not do that, so we drop *http(s)* prior to comparing strings in *seq-sort*'s predicate. [replace-regexp-in-string](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/3af9e84ff59811734dcbb5d55e04e1fdb7051e77/lisp/subr.el#L4468) does the job here, but if you'd like to skip regular expressions, [string-remove-prefix](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/3af9e84ff59811734dcbb5d55e04e1fdb7051e77/lisp/emacs-lisp/subr-x.el#L255) works just as well.

Yay, sorting no longer cares about http vs https:

    https://andymatuschak.org
    http://antirez.com
    https://apenwarr.ca/log
    ...

With all that in mind, let's flatten list processing using [thread-last](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/3af9e84ff59811734dcbb5d55e04e1fdb7051e77/lisp/emacs-lisp/subr-x.el#L69). This isn't strictly necessary, but since this is the 2021 edition, we'll throw in this macro added to Emacs in 2016 as part of 25.1. Arthur Malabarba has a [great post on thread-last](https://endlessparentheses.com/new-in-emacs-25-1-more-flow-control-macros.html).

Now that we've built out *ar/scrape-links-from-clipboard-url* function, let's make its content consumable!

## The completing frameworks way

This is the 2021 edition, so power up your completion framework du jour and feed the output of *ar/scrape-links-from-clipboard-url* to our completion robots…

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-link-scraping-2021-edition/scrape_complete.gif)

I'm heavily vested in [ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper), but since we're using the built-in [completing-read](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Completion.html) function, any completion framework like [vertico](https://github.com/minad/vertico), [selectrum](https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum/), [helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm), or [ido](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ido/index.html) should kick right in to give you extra powers.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(defun ar/view-completing-links-at-clipboard-url ()
  "Scrape links from clipboard URL and open all in external browser."
  (interactive)
  (browse-url (completing-read "links: "
                               (ar/scrape-links-from-clipboard-url))))
```

## The auto-open way (use with caution)

Sometimes you just want to open every link posted in the comments and use your browser to discard, closing tabs as needed. The recent HN news instance wasn't one of these cases, with a whopping 398 links returned by our *ar/scrape-links-from-clipboard-url*.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-link-scraping-2021-edition/scrape_browse.gif)

*Note: I capped the results to 5 in this gif/demo to prevent a Firefox tragedy (see [seq-take](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/3af9e84ff59811734dcbb5d55e04e1fdb7051e77/lisp/emacs-lisp/seq.el#L231)).*

In a case like Hacker News's, we don't want to surprise-attack the user and bomb their browser by opening a gazillion tabs, so let's give a little heads-up using [y-or-n-p](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/3af9e84ff59811734dcbb5d55e04e1fdb7051e77/lisp/subr.el#L2869).

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(defun ar/browse-links-at-clipboard-url ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((links (ar/scrape-links-from-clipboard-url)))
    (when (y-or-n-p (format "Open all %d links? " (length links)))
      (mapc (lambda (link)
              (browse-url link))
            links))))
```

## The org way

My [2015 solution](get-emacs-to-gather-links-in-posts/) leveraged an [org mode](https://orgmode.org/) buffer to dump the fetched links. The org way is still my favorite. You can use whatever existing Emacs super powers you already have on top of the org buffer, including searching and filtering fueled by your favourite completion framework. I'm a fan of [Oleh](https://oremacs.com/)'s [swiper](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-link-scraping-2021-edition/scrape_org.gif)

The 2021 implementation is mostly a tidy-up, removing some cruft, but also uses our new *ar/scrape-links-from-clipboard-url* function to filter and sort accordingly.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(require 'org)

(defun ar/view-links-at-clipboard-url ()
  "Scrape links from clipboard URL and dump to an org buffer."
  (interactive)
  (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create "*links*")
    (org-mode)
    (erase-buffer)
    (mapc (lambda (link)
            (insert (org-make-link-string link) "\n"))
          (ar/scrape-links-from-clipboard-url))
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (switch-to-buffer (current-buffer))))
```

## Emacs + community + packages + your own glue = awesome

To power our 2021 link scraper, we've used newer libraries included in more recent versions of Emacs, leveraged an older but solid HTML-parsing package, pulled in org mode (the epicenter of Emacs note-taking), dragged in our favorite completion framework, and tickled our handy browser all by smothering the lot with some elisp glue to make Emacs do exactly what we want. [Emacs does rock](http://emacsrocks.com/).

Ray Oei's Stack Overflow [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66234166) solved the mystery for me: pinentry never got invoked, so likely something's up with the agent… Killing (and thus restaring) the gpg-agent did the trick:

---
id: emacs-plus-with-native-comp

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-plus-with-native-comp/brew-native-comp.png)

I'm a big fan of [Boris Buliga](https://d12frosted.io/)'s [Emacs Plus](https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus) [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) recipe for customizing and installing Emacs builds on macOS.

For a little while, I took a detour and built Emacs myself, so I could enable [Andrea Corallo](https://twitter.com/Koral_001)'s fantastic [native compilation](http://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html). I documented the steps [here](trying-out-gccemacs-on-macos/). Though it was fairly straightforward, I did miss Emacs Plus's convenience.

I had been meaning to check back on Emacs Plus for native compilation support. Turns out, it was merged back in [Dec 2020](https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/pull/188), and it works great!

Enabling native compilation is simple (just use *–with-native-comp*). As a bonus, you get all the Emacs Plus goodies. I'm loving *–with-elrumo2-icon*, enabling a spiffy icon to go with macOS Big Sur. *–with-no-frame-refocus* is also handy to [avoid refocusing other frames](no-emacs-frame-refocus-on-macos/) when another one is closed.

In any case, here's the minimum needed to install Emacs Plus with native compilation support enabled:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
brew install emacs-plus@28 --with-native-comp
```

Sit tight. Homebrew will build and install some chunky dependencies (including gcc and libgccjit).

Note: Your init.el needs tweaking to take advantage of native compilation. See my [previous post](trying-out-gccemacs-on-macos/) for how I set mine, or go straight to [my config](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/features/fe-package-extensions.el#L19).

Rectangle looks great. Although I've not yet adopted it, Todo mode really resonates with me. I've been achieving similar functionality with [hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/cycling-window-layouts-via-hammerspoon/cycle.gif)

Here's a quick and dirty function to cycle through my window layouts:

``` python
function reframeFocusedWindow()
   local win = hs.window.focusedWindow()
   local maximizedFrame = win:screen():frame()
   maximizedFrame.x = maximizedFrame.x + 15
   maximizedFrame.y = maximizedFrame.y + 15
   maximizedFrame.w = maximizedFrame.w - 30
   maximizedFrame.h = maximizedFrame.h - 30

   local leftFrame = win:screen():frame()
   leftFrame.x = leftFrame.x + 15
   leftFrame.y = leftFrame.y + 15
   leftFrame.w = leftFrame.w - 250
   leftFrame.h = leftFrame.h - 30

   local rightFrame = win:screen():frame()
   rightFrame.x = rightFrame.w - 250 + 15
   rightFrame.y = rightFrame.y + 15
   rightFrame.w = 250 - 15 - 15
   rightFrame.h = rightFrame.h - 30

   -- Make space on right
   if win:frame() == maximizedFrame then
     win:setFrame(leftFrame)
     return
   end

   -- Make space on left
   if win:frame() == leftFrame then
     win:setFrame(rightFrame)
     return
   end

   win:setFrame(maximizedFrame)

## org import (import vs in-place)

We can now import org files from the menu. Importing gives ya the option to either import (copy into the app) or open in-place. The latter enables users to sync org files with other iOS apps or just open/edit from Emacs for the full org-mode/agenda experience.

Syncing with your desktop can be achieved by either iCloud or by enabling other providers in the Files app (after installing the likes of Google Drive, Dropbox, etc).

*Please note that importing (copying into the app) is currently the recommended flow.* Opening in-place and syncing is still fairly experimental, so please back up your org files regularly. If you do run into syncing issues, please get in touch.

Good luck with your habits!

## So what is it?

An iOS app to help you form and track lasting habits.

  </a>
</center>

## Why an app?

Tracking and accountability may help you develop positive habits. A simple habit-tracking app should make this easy. I'm not a habits expert, but got inspired by James Clear's [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits). Read that book if you're interested in the topic.

I wanted a frictionless habit tracker that gets out of the way, so I built one to my taste.

## Sounds like a lot of work?

You mean habit tracking? It's not. I tried to make the app simple and focused. Mark a habit done whenever you do it. It's really encouraging to see your daily streaks grow. I really don't want to break them.

## What kind of habits?

Any recurring habit you'd like to form like exercise, water the plants, read, make your bed, recycle, call grandma, yoga, cleaning, drink water, meditate, take a nap, make your lunch, journal, laundry, push-ups, sort out the dryer filter, floz, take your vitamins, take your meds, eat salad, eat fruit, practice a language, practice an instrument, go to bed early…

## So it's like a task/todo app?

Nope. This app focuses solely on habits. Unlike todos/tasks, habits must happen regularly. If you don't water the plants, they will die. If you don't exercise regularly, you won't get the health benefits. Keep your habits separate from that long list of todos. You know, that panic-inducing list you're too afraid to look at.

## Where is my data stored?

On your iPhone as a plain text file (in [org mode](https://orgmode.org/) format). You can view, edit, or migrate your data at any time (use export from the menu). You may also save it to a shared location, so you can access it from multiple devices/apps. Some of us like to [use our beloved text editors](http://xenodium.com/frictionless-org-habits-on-ios/) (Emacs, Vim, VSCode, etc.) to poke at [habits](https://orgmode.org/manual/Tracking-your-habits.html).

## Got more questions?

I may not have the answer, but I can try. Ping me at *flathabits\*at\*xenodium.com*.

## Privacy policy

No personal data is sent to any server, as there is no server component to this app. There are neither third party integrations, accounts, analytics, nor trackers in this app. All your data is kept on your iPhone, unless you choose a cloud provider to sync or store your data. See your cloud provider's privacy policy for details on how they may handle it.

If you choose to send feedback by email, you have the option to review and attach logs to help diagnose issues. If you'd like an email thread to be deleted, just ask.

UPDATE: Flat Habits now has its own page at [flathabits.com](https://flathabits.com/).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/frictionless-org-habits-on-ios/flat_habits.gif)

I've been wanting org to keep track of my daily habits for a little while. The catalyst: reading James Clear's wonderful [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) (along with plenty of lock-down inspiration).

As much as I live in Emacs and org mode, it just wasn't practical enough to rely on my laptop for tracking habits. I wanted less friction, so I've been experimenting with building a toy app for my needs. Naturally, org support was a strict requirement, so I could always poke at it from my beloved editor.

I've been using the app every day with success. The habits seem to be sticking, but equally important, it's been really fun to join the fabulous world of Emacs/Org with iOS/SwiftUI.

This is all very experimental[^3] and as mentioned on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ljurwx/org_habits_ios_app_want_to_try_it/) (follow-up [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/lp62vn/org_habits_ios_app_followup_twoway_edit/)) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/xenodium/status/1361034010047176705), the app isn't available on the App Store. I may consider publishing if there's enough interest, but in the mean time, you can reach out and install via [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/).

Send me an email address to *flathabits\*at\*xenodium.com* for a TestFlight invite.

## 2021-03-12 Update: Now with iOS Files app/sync integration

If you can sync your org file with your iPhone (ie. Drive/Dropbox/iCloud), and list it in the Files app, you should be able to open/edit[^4] with *Flat Habits* (that's the name now). With iOS Files integration, you should be able to sync your habits between your iPhone and your [funky editor](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) powering org mode[^5].

# \[2020-12-29 Tue\] Swift package code coverage (plus Emacs overlay)
---
id: swift-package-code-coverage
---

While playing around with Swift package manager, I had a quick look into code coverage options. Luckily, coverage reporting and exporting are supported out of the box (via [llvm-cov](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-cov.html)).

Ensure tests are invoked as follows:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
swift test --enable-code-coverage
```

A high level report can be generated with:

``` {.bash results="verbatim"}
xcrun llvm-cov report .build/x86_64-apple-macosx/debug/FooPackageTests.xctest/Contents/MacOS/FooPackageTests \
      -instr-profile=.build/x86_64-apple-macosx/debug/codecov/default.profdata -ignore-filename-regex=".build|Tests"
```

llvm-cov can export as lcov format:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
xcrun llvm-cov export -format="lcov" .build/x86_64-apple-macosx/debug/FooPackageTests.xctest/Contents/MacOS/FooPackageTests -instr-profile=.build/x86_64-apple-macosx/debug/codecov/default.profdata -ignore-filename-regex=".build|Tests" > coverage.lcov
```

With the report in lcov format, we can look for an Emacs package to visualize coverage in source files. Found [coverlay.el](https://github.com/twada/coverlay.el) to require minimal setup. I was interested in highlighting only untested areas, so I set *tested-line-background-color* to nil:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(use-package coverlay
  :ensure t
  :config
  (setq coverlay:tested-line-background-color nil))
```

After installing coverlay, I enabled the minor mode via *M-x coverlay-minor-mode*, invoked *M-x coverlay-watch-file* to watch *coverage.lcov* for changes, and voilà!

# \[2020-12-05 Sat\] Emacs: Rotate my macOS display

id: emacs-rotate-my-macos-display

Every so often, I rotate my monitor (vertical vs horizontal) for either work or to watch a movie. macOS enables changing the display rotation via a dropdown menu (under *Preferences \> Displays \> Rotation*) where you can pick between *Standard*, *90°*, *180°*, and *270°*. That's all fine, but what I'd really like is a quick way to toggle between my preferred two choices: *Standard* and *270°*.

Unsurprisingly, I'd also like to invoke it as an interactive command via Emacs's *M-x* (see [Emacs: connect my Bluetooth speaker](http://xenodium.com/emacs-connect-my-bluetooth-speaker/index.html)). With narrowing frameworks like [ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper), [helm](https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/), and [ido](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/ido.html), invoking these commands is just a breeze.

Turns out, this was pretty simple to accomplish, thanks to Eric Nitardy's [fb-rotate](https://github.com/CdLbB/fb-rotate) command line utility. All that's left to do is wrap it in a tiny elisp ~~function~~ hack, add the toggling logic, and voilà!

*The screen capture goes a little funky when rotating the display, but you get the idea. It works better in person :)*

…and here's the snippet:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}

  (interactive)
  (require 'cl-lib)
  (cl-assert (executable-find "fb-rotate") nil
             "Install fb-rotate from https://github.com/CdLbB/fb-rotate")
  ;; #  Display_ID    Resolution  ____Display_Bounds____  Rotation
  ;; 2  0x2b347692    1440x2560      0     0  1440  2560    270    [main]
  ;; From fb-rotate output, get the `current-rotation' from Column 7, row 1 zero-based.
  (let ((current-rotation (nth 7 (split-string (nth 1 (process-lines "fb-rotate" "-i"))))))
    (call-process-shell-command (format "fb-rotate -d 1 -r %s"
                                        (if (equal current-rotation "270")
                                            "0"
                                          "270")))))
```

# \[2020-11-29 Sun\] Emacs: Clone git repo from clipboard
---
id: emacs-clone-git-repo-from-clipboard
---

Cloning git repositories is a pretty common task. For me, it typically goes something like:

-   Copy git repo URL from browser.
-   Drop to Emacs eshell.
-   Change current directory.
-   Type "git clone ".
-   Paste git repo URL.
-   Run git command.
-   Change directory to cloned repo.
-   Open dired.

No biggie, but why go through the same steps every time? We can do better. We have a hyper malleable editor, so let's get it to grab the URL from clipboard and do its thing.

*shell-command* or *async-shell-command* can help in this space, but require additional work: change location, re-type command, what if directory already exists… This is Emacs, so we can craft the exact experience we want. I did take inspiration from *shell-command* to display the process buffer correctly (git progress, control codes, etc.) and landed on the following experience:

# \[2020-11-23 Mon\] Pulled pork recipe
---
id: pulled-pork-recipe
---

Made pulled pork a couple of times. Freestyled a bit. No expert here, but result was yummie.

## Grind/blend spices

-   2 teaspoons smoked paprika
-   2 teaspoons cumin seeds
-   2 teaspoons whole pepper corn mix
-   2 teaspoons chilly flakes

If spices are whole, grind or blend them. Set aside.

Optionally: Substitute 1 teaspoon of paprika with chipotle pepper.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/pulled-pork-recipe/grind.jpg)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/pulled-pork-recipe/ground.jpg)

## Mix into a paste

-   2 tablespoons honey
-   1 teaspoon of dijon mustard

Mix the honey, mustard, and previous spices into a paste.

## Rub the mix in

Rub mix thoroughly into the pork shoulder.

## Bake (1 hour)

Place in a pot (lid off) and bake in the oven for 1 hour at 200 °C.

## Add liquids

-   1/2 cup of water.
-   4 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar.

Add liquids to pot.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/pulled-pork-recipe/almost.jpg)

## Bake (3-5 hours)

Bake between 3 to 5 hours 150 °C. Check every hour or two. Does the meat fall easily when spread with two forks? If so, you're done.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/pulled-pork-recipe/out.jpg)

## Pull apart

Use two forks to pull the meat apart.

# \[2020-10-27 Tue\] Emacs: chaining org babel blocks
---
id: emacs-chaining-org-babel-blocks
---

Recently wanted to chain org babel blocks. That is, aggregate separate source blocks and execute as one combined block.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-chaining-org-babel-blocks/chain.gif)

I wanted the chaining primarily driven through header arguments as follows:

``` org
#+name: block-0
#+begin_src swift
  print("hello 0")
#+end_src

#+name: block-1
#+begin_src swift :include block-0
  print("hello 1")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: block-1
: hello 0
: hello 1
```

I didn't find the above syntax and behaviour supported out of the box (or didn't search hard enough?). Fortunately, this is our beloved and malleable editor, so we can always bend it our way! Wasn't quite sure how to go about it, so I looked at other babel packages for inspiration. [ob-async](https://github.com/astahlman/ob-async) was great for that.

Turns out, advicing *org-babel-execute-src-block* did the job:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(defun adviced:org-babel-execute-src-block (&optional orig-fun arg info params)
  (let ((body (nth 1 info))
        (include (assoc :include (nth 2 info)))
        (named-blocks (org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer)
                          'src-block (lambda (item)
                                       (when (org-element-property :name item)
                                         (cons (org-element-property :name item)
                                               item))))))
    (while include
      (unless (cdr include)
        (user-error ":include without value" (cdr include)))
      (unless (assoc (cdr include) named-blocks)
        (user-error "source block \"%s\" not found" (cdr include)))
      (setq body (concat (org-element-property :value (cdr (assoc (cdr include) named-blocks)))
                         body))
      (setf (nth 1 info) body)
      (setq include (assoc :include
                           (org-babel-parse-header-arguments
                            (org-element-property :parameters (cdr (assoc (cdr include) named-blocks)))))))
    (funcall orig-fun arg info params)))

(advice-add 'org-babel-execute-src-block :around 'adviced:org-babel-execute-src-block)
```

Before I built my own support, I did find that [noweb](https://orgmode.org/manual/Noweb-Reference-Syntax.html) got me most of what I needed, but required sprinkling blocks with placeholder references.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-chaining-org-babel-blocks/noweb.gif)

Combining [:noweb](https://orgmode.org/manual/Noweb-Reference-Syntax.html) and [:prologue](https://org-babel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/header-args/#prologue) would have been a great match, if only prologue did expand the noweb reference. I'm sure there's an alternative I'm missing. Either way, it was fun to poke at babel blocks and build my own chaining support.

As I find myself moving more shell commands into Emacs interactive commands to [create a Swift package/project](http://xenodium.com/emacs-create-a-swift-packageproject/), [enrich dired's featureset](http://xenodium.com/enrich-your-dired-batching-toolbox/), or [search/play Music (macOS)](http://xenodium.com/emacs-searchplay-music-macos/), I often need to take a single space-separated string, make an elisp list of strings, and feed it to functions like *process-lines*. No biggie, but I thought it'd be a fun little function to write: take the region and wrap all items in quotes. As a bonus, made it toggable.

# \[2020-10-18 Sun\] Emacs: org block complete and edit
---
id: emacs-edit-after-org-block-completion

I quickly got used to [Emacs org block company completion](http://xenodium.com/emacs-org-block-company-completion/). I did, however, almost always found myself running *org-edit-special* immediately after inserting completion. I use **C-c '** for that. That's all fine, but it just felt redundant.

Why not automatically edit the source block in corresponding major mode after completion? I think I can also get used to that!

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-edit-after-org-block-completion/automatic.gif)

Or maybe the automatic approach is too eager? There's also a middle ground: ask immediately after.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-edit-after-org-block-completion/prompted.gif)

Or maybe I don't want either in the end? Time will tell, but I now have all three options available:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(defcustom company-org-block-edit-mode 'auto
  "Customize whether edit mode, post completion was inserted."
  :type '(choice
          (const :tag "nil: no edit after insertion" nil)
          (const :tag "prompt: ask before edit" prompt)
          (const :tag "auto edit, no prompt" auto)))
```

The new option is now in the [company-org-block snippet](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/main/emacs/ar/company-org-block.el) with my latest config.

# \[2020-10-11 Sun\] Emacs: create a Swift package/project
---
id: emacs-create-a-swift-packageproject
---

Been playing around with [Swift Package Manager (SPM)](https://swift.org/package-manager/). Creating a new Swift package (ie. project) is pretty simple.

To create a library package, we can use the following:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
swift package init --type library
```

Alternatively, to create a command-line utility use:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
swift package init --type executable
```

Turns out, there are a few options: empty, library, executable, system-module, manifest.

With a little elisp, we can write a completing function to quickly generate a Swift package/project without the need to drop to the shell.

Bonus: I won't have to look up SPM options if I ever forget them.

# \[2020-10-04 Sun\] Improved Ctrl-p/Ctrl-n macOS movement
---
id: improved-ctrl-p-ctrl-n-macos-movement
---

macOS supports many Emacs bindings (out of the box). You can, for example, press C-p and C-n to move the cursor up and down (whether editing text in Emacs or any other macOS app). Jacob Rus's [Customizing the Cocoa Text System](http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/site/cocoa-text.html) offers a more in-depth picture and also shows how to customize global macOS keybindings (via DefaultKeyBinding.dict).

In addition to moving Emacs [point](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Point.html) (cursor) up/down using C-p/C-n, I've internalized the same bindings to select an option from a list. Good Emacs examples of these are [company mode](https://company-mode.github.io/) and [ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper).

Vertical cursor movement using Emacs bindings works well in most macOS apps, including forms and text boxes in web pages. However, selecting from a completion list doesn't quite work as expected. Although the binding is technically handled, it moves the cursor within the text widget, ignoring the suggested choices.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/improved-ctrl-p-ctrl-n-macos-movement/bindings-borked.gif)

Atif Afzal's [Use emacs key bindings everywhere](https://www.atfzl.com/use-emacs-key-bindings-everywhere) has a solution for the ignored case. He uses [Karabiner Elements](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements) to remap c-p and c-n to arrow-up and arrow-down.

It's been roughly a week since I started using the Karabiner remapping, and I've yet to find a case where a web page (or any other macOS app) did not respond to c-p and c-n to move selection from a list.

## Bonus (C-g to exit)

Pressing Esc often dismisses or cancels macOS windows, menus, etc. This is also the case for web pages. As an Emacs user, I'm pretty used to pressing C-g to cancel, quit, or exit things. With that in mind, mapping C-g to Esc is surprisingly useful outside of Emacs. Here's the relevant Karabiner C-g binding for that:

``` json
{
    "description": "Ctrl+G to Escape",
    "manipulators": [
        {
            "description": "emacs like escape",
            "from": {
                "key_code": "g",
                "modifiers": {
                    "mandatory": [
                        "left_control"
                    ]
                }
            },
            "to": [
                {
                    "key_code": "escape"
                }
            ],
            "conditions": [
                {
                    "type": "frontmost_application_unless",
                    "bundle_identifiers": [
                        "^org\\.gnu\\.Emacs"
                    ]
                }
            ],
            "conditions": [
                {
                    "type": "frontmost_application_unless",
                    "bundle_identifiers": [
                        "^org\\.gnu\\.Emacs"
                    ]
                }
            ],
            "type": "basic"
        }
    ]
}
```

ps. Note to self: Lennart's blog has [notes on the topic but for linux](https://blog.karssen.org/2024/06/05/using-emacs-key-bindings-in-gnome-firefox-and-other-applications/).

UPDATE: Ensure bindings are only active when Emacs is [not]{.underline} active.

The macOS Preview app does a great job inserting signatures to existing pdfs. I was hoping it could overlay images just as easily. Doesn't look like it's possible, without exporting/reimporting to image formats and losing pdf structure. Did I miss something?

In any case, I found [formulatepro](https://code.google.com/archive/p/formulatepro/). Dormant at Google Code Archive, but also [checked in to github](https://github.com/adlr/formulatepro). With a tiny [patch](https://github.com/xenodium/formulatepro/commit/cd43b1e73c2f180f4b4b7fb11fdec975b6960dc6), it builds and runs on Catalina. One can easily insert an image via "File \> Place Image…".

# \[2020-09-19 Sat\] Emacs: search/play Music (macOS)
---
id: emacs-searchplay-music-macos
---

While trying out macOS's Music app to manage offline media, I wondered if I could easily search and control playback from Emacs. Spoiler alert: yes it can be done and fuzzy searching music is rather gratifying.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-searchplay-music-macos/music_search.gif)

Luckily, the hard work's already handled by [pytunes](https://github.com/hile/pytunes), a command line interface to macOS's iTunes/Music app. We add [ffprobe](https://ffmpeg.org/ffprobe.html) and some elisp glue to the mix, and we can generate an Emacs media index.

Indexing takes roughly a minute per 1000 files. Prolly suboptimal, but I don't intend to re-index frequently. For now, we can use a separate process to prevent Emacs from blocking, so we can get back to playing tetris from our beloved editor:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}

Once media is indexed, we can feed it to [ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) for that narrowing-down fuzzy-searching goodness! It's worth mentioning the [truncate-string-to-width](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Size-of-Displayed-Text.html) function. Super handy for truncating strings to a fixed width and visually organizing search results in columns.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(defun musica-search ()
  (interactive)
  (cl-assert (executable-find "pytunes") nil "pytunes not installed")
  (let* ((c1-width (round (* (- (window-width) 9) 0.4)))
         (c2-width (round (* (- (window-width) 9) 0.3)))
         (c3-width (- (window-width) 9 c1-width c2-width)))
    (ivy-read "Play: " (mapcar
                        (lambda (track)
                          (let-alist track
                            (cons (format "%s   %s   %s"
                                          (truncate-string-to-width
                                           (or .tags.title
                                               (file-name-base .filename)
                                               "No title") c1-width nil ?\s "…")
                                          (truncate-string-to-width (propertize (or .tags.artist "")
                                                                                'face '(:foreground "yellow")) c2-width nil ?\s "…")
                                          (truncate-string-to-width
                                           (propertize (or .tags.album "")
                                                       'face '(:foreground "cyan1")) c3-width nil ?\s "…"))
                                  track)))
                        (musica--index))
              :action (lambda (selection)
                        (let-alist (cdr selection)
                          (process-lines "pytunes" "play" .filename)
                          (message "Playing: %s [%s] %s"
                                   (or .tags.title
                                       (file-name-base .filename)
                                       "No title")
                                   (or .tags.artist
                                       "No artist")
                                   (or .tags.album
                                       "No album")))))))

(defun musica--index ()
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents "~/.emacs.d/.musica.el")
    (read (current-buffer))))
```

The remaining bits are straigtforward. We add a few interactive functions to control playback:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(defun musica-info ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((raw (process-lines "pytunes" "info")))
    (message "%s [%s] %s"
             (string-trim (string-remove-prefix "Title" (nth 3 raw)))
             (string-trim (string-remove-prefix "Artist" (nth 1 raw)))
             (string-trim (string-remove-prefix "Album" (nth 2 raw))))))

(defun musica-play-pause ()
  (interactive)
  (cl-assert (executable-find "pytunes") nil "pytunes not installed")
  (process-lines "pytunes" "play")
  (musica-info))

(defun musica-play-next ()
  (interactive)
  (cl-assert (executable-find "pytunes") nil "pytunes not installed")
  (process-lines "pytunes" "next"))

(defun musica-play-next-random ()
  (interactive)
  (cl-assert (executable-find "pytunes") nil "pytunes not installed")
  (process-lines "pytunes" "shuffle" "enable")
  (let-alist (seq-random-elt (musica--index))
    (process-lines "pytunes" "play" .filename))
  (musica-info))

(defun musica-play-previous ()
  (interactive)
  (cl-assert (executable-find "pytunes") nil "pytunes not installed")
  (process-lines "pytunes" "previous"))
```

Finally, if we want some convenient keybindings, we can add something like:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c m SPC") #'musica-play-pause)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c m i") #'musica-info)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c m n") #'musica-play-next)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c m p") #'musica-play-previous)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c m r") #'musica-play-next-random)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c m s") #'musica-search)
```

Hooray! Controlling music is now an Emacs keybinding away: ø/

UPDATE1: Installing pytunes with *pip3 install pytunes* didn't just work for me. Instead, I cloned and installed as:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
git clone https://github.com/hile/pytunes
pip3 install file:///path/to/pytunes
pip3 install pytz
brew install libmagic
```

## Preheat oven

Preheat oven at 175°C.

## Ingredients at room temperature

Ensure the cream cheese, sour cream, and eggs are at room temperature before starting.

## Mix cream cheese

-   900g of cream cheese

Mix the cream cheese thoroughly.

## Mix sugar

-   240g of sugar

Add half the sugar. Mix in thoroughly. Add second half and mix.

## Mix sour cream, corn flour, and vanilla.

-   100g sour cream
-   40g corn flour
-   1tbsp vanilla bean paste

Add the three ingredients and mix well.

## Mix eggs

-   3 eggs
-   1 egg yolk

Add the eggs and mix for 30 seconds.

## Mix by hand

Finish mixing thoroughly by hand, using a wooden spoon.

## Prepare pan

-   Springform pan
-   Parchment paper

A springform pan works best here. Wrap its plate with parchment paper and lock it in place.

## Pour mix

-   Strainer

Pour the mix through a strainer and into the prepared pan.

## Rest mix

Let the mix rest in the pan for 10 minutes to let air bubbles out.

## Bake

Bake for an 1 hour 10 minutes. Maybe add another 10 minutes (or more) if surface is still pale. Turn the oven off, leave door half open, and let it sit for 20 minutes.

## Cool off

Take out and let it cool off to room temperature.

## Refrigerate

Refrigerate for 4 hours (or overnight) before removing the sides of the pan.

## Eat!

Nom nom. Yum yum.

## Bonus (topping)

I winged this one and it worked out well. Heated up frozen berries with some honey and used it as topping. The whole combo was pretty tasty.

[Jari Safi](https://twitter.com/safijari) published a wonderful Emacs video [demoing python yasnippets in action](https://youtu.be/xmBovJvQ3KU). The constructor snippet, automatically setting ivars, is just magical. I wanted it for Swift!

I took a look at the [[[init]{.underline}]{.underline} snippet](https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy/blob/060a4eb78ec8eba9c8fe3466c40a414d84b3dc81/snippets/python-mode/__init__) from [Jorgen Schäfer](https://github.com/jorgenschaefer)'s [elpy](https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy). It uses [elpy-snippet-init-assignments](https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy/blob/060a4eb78ec8eba9c8fe3466c40a414d84b3dc81/snippets/python-mode/.yas-setup.el#L33) to generate the assignments.

With small tweaks, we can get the same action going on for Swift ø/

# \[2020-08-23 Sun\] Swift package manager build for iOS
---
id: swift-package-manager-build-for-ios
---

While playing around with Swift package manager, it wasn't immediately obvious how to build for iOS from the command line. The default behaviour of invoking *swift build* is to build for the host. In my case, macOS. In any case, this was it:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
swift build -Xswiftc "-sdk" -Xswiftc "/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator13.0.sdk" -Xswiftc "-target" -Xswiftc "x86_64-apple-ios13.0-simulator"
```

ps. Can get the SDK path with:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
xcrun --sdk iphonesimulator --show-sdk-path
```

# \[2020-08-16 Sun\] Trying out gccemacs on macOS
---
id: trying-out-gccemacs-on-macos
---

*UPDATE: I'm no longer using these steps. See [Emacs plus –with-native-comp](emacs-plus-with-native-comp/) for an easier alternative.*

Below are the instructions I use to build Andrea Corallo's [gccemacs](http://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html) on macOS. It is based on [Allen Dang](https://github.com/AllenDang)'s handy [instructions](https://gist.github.com/AllenDang/f019593e65572a8e0aefc96058a2d23e) plus some changes of my own.

## Install gcc and libgccjit via homebrew

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install gcc libgccjit
```

## Save configure script

Create configure-gccemacs.sh

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
#!/bin/bash

set -o nounset
set -o errexit

# Configures Emacs for building native comp support
# http://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html

readonly GCC_DIR="$(realpath $(brew --prefix libgccjit))"
[[ -d $GCC_DIR ]] ||  { echo "${GCC_DIR} not found"; exit 1; }

readonly SED_DIR="$(realpath $(brew --prefix gnu-sed))"
[[ -d $SED_DIR ]] ||  { echo "${SED_DIR} not found"; exit 1; }

readonly GCC_INCLUDE_DIR=${GCC_DIR}/include
[[ -d $GCC_INCLUDE_DIR ]] ||  { echo "${GCC_INCLUDE_DIR} not found"; exit 1; }

readonly GCC_LIB_DIR=${GCC_DIR}/lib/gcc/10
[[ -d $GCC_LIB_DIR ]] ||  { echo "${GCC_LIB_DIR} not found"; exit 1; }

export PATH="${SED_DIR}/libexec/gnubin:${PATH}"
export CFLAGS="-O2 -I${GCC_INCLUDE_DIR}"
export LDFLAGS="-L${GCC_LIB_DIR} -I${GCC_INCLUDE_DIR}"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${GCC_LIB_DIR}"
export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH="${GCC_LIB_DIR}"

echo "Environment"
echo "-----------"
echo PATH: $PATH
echo CFLAGS: $CFLAGS
echo LDFLAGS: $LDFLAGS
echo DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH: $DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH
echo "-----------"

./autogen.sh

./configure \
     --prefix="$PWD/nextstep/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS" \
     --enable-locallisppath="${PWD}/nextstep/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS" \
     --with-mailutils \
     --with-ns \
     --with-imagemagick \
     --with-cairo \
     --with-modules \
     --with-xml2 \
     --with-gnutls \
     --with-json \
     --with-rsvg \
     --with-native-compilation \
     --disable-silent-rules \
     --disable-ns-self-contained \
     --without-dbus
```

Make it executable

``` shell
chmod +x configure-gccemacs.sh
```

## Clone Emacs source

``` shell
git clone --branch master https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs gccemacs
```

## Configure build

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
cd gccemacs
../configure-gccemacs.sh
```

## Native lisp compiler found?

Verify native lisp compiler is found:

``` fundamental
Does Emacs have native lisp compiler?                   yes
```

## Build

Put those cores to use. Find out how many you got with:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
sysctl hw.logicalcpu
```

Ok so build with:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
make -j4 NATIVE_FAST_BOOT=1
cp -r lisp nextstep/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/
cp -r native-lisp nextstep/Emacs.app/Contents
make install
```

**Note:** Using *NATIVE_FAST_BOOT=1* significantly improves build time (totalling between 20-30 mins, depending on your specs). Without it, the build can take **hours**.

The macOS app build (under nextstep/Emacs.app) is ready, but read on before launching.

## Remove \~/emacs.d

You likely want to start with a clean install, byte-compiling all packages with the latest Emacs version. In any case, rename \~/emacs.d (for backup?) or remove \~/emacs.d.

## init.el config

Ensure *exec-path* includes the script's "–prefix=" value, *LIBRARY_PATH* points to gcc's lib dir, and finally set *comp-deferred-compilation*. I wrapped the snippet in my *exec-path-from-shell* config, but setting early in init.el should be enough.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(use-package exec-path-from-shell
  :ensure t
  :config
  (exec-path-from-shell-initialize)
  (if (and (fboundp 'native-comp-available-p)
           (native-comp-available-p))
      (progn
        (message "Native comp is available")
        ;; Using Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin since it was compiled with
        ;; ./configure --prefix="$PWD/nextstep/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS"
        (add-to-list 'exec-path (concat invocation-directory "bin") t)
        (setenv "LIBRARY_PATH" (concat (getenv "LIBRARY_PATH")
                                       (when (getenv "LIBRARY_PATH")
                                         ":")
                                       ;; This is where Homebrew puts gcc libraries.
                                       (car (file-expand-wildcards
                                             (expand-file-name "~/homebrew/opt/gcc/lib/gcc/*")))))
        ;; Only set after LIBRARY_PATH can find gcc libraries.
        (setq comp-deferred-compilation t))
    (message "Native comp is *not* available")))
```

## Launch Emacs.app

You're good to go. Open Emacs.app via finder or shell:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
open nextstep/Emacs.app
```

## Deferred compilation logs

After setting *comp-deferred-compilation* (in init.el config section), .elc files should be asyncronously compiled. Function definition should be updated to native compiled equivalent.

Look out for an ****Async-native-compile-log**** buffer. Should have content like:

``` fundamental
Compiling .emacs.d/elpa/moody-20200514.1946/moody.el...
Compiling .emacs.d/elpa/minions-20200522.1052/minions.el...
Compiling .emacs.d/elpa/persistent-scratch-20190922.1046/persistent-scratch.el...
Compiling .emacs.d/elpa/which-key-20200721.1927/which-key.el...
...
```

Can also check for .eln files:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
find ~/.emacs.d -iname *.eln | wc -l
```

UPDATE1: Added *Symlink Emacs.app/Contents/eln-cache* section for [update 11](http://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html#org4b11ea1).

UPDATE2: Noted using NATIVE_FAST_BOOT makes the build much faster.

UPDATE3: Removed symlinks and copied content instead. This simplifies things. Inspired by Ian Wahbe's [build-emacs.sh](https://github.com/iwahbe/doom-config/blob/master/build-emacs.sh).

UPDATE4: Removed homebrew recipe patching. Thanks to Dmitry Shishkin's [instructions](https://github.com/shshkn/emacs.d/blob/master/docs/nativecomp.md).

UPDATE5: Use new flag –with-native-compilation and master branch.

# \[2020-08-02 Sun\] SwiftUI macOS desk clock
---
id: swiftui-desk-clock

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/swiftui-desk-clock/everclock.gif)

For time display, I've gone back and forth between an always-displayed macOS's menu bar to an auto-hide menu bar, and letting Emacs display the time. Neither felt great nor settled.

With some tweaks, Paul Hudson's [How to use a timer with SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-use-a-timer-with-swiftui), led me to build a simple desk clock. Ok, let's not get fancy. It's really just an always-on-top floating window, showing a swiftUI label, but hey I like the minimalist feel ;)

Let's see if it sticks around or it gets in the way… Either way, here's standalone snippet. Run with *swift deskclock.swift*.

``` swift
import Cocoa
import SwiftUI

let application = NSApplication.shared
let appDelegate = AppDelegate()
NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.regular)
application.delegate = appDelegate
application.mainMenu = NSMenu.makeMenu()
application.run()

struct ClockView: View {
  @State var time = "--:--"

  let timer = Timer.publish(every: 1, on: .main, in: .common).autoconnect()

  var body: some View {
    GeometryReader { geometry in

      VStack {
        Text(time)
          .onReceive(timer) { input in
            let formatter = DateFormatter()
            formatter.dateFormat = "HH:mm"
            time = formatter.string(from: input)
          }
          .font(.system(size: 40))
          .padding()
      }.frame(width: geometry.size.width, height: geometry.size.height)
        .background(Color.black)
        .cornerRadius(10)
        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)
    }
  }
}

extension NSWindow {
  static func makeWindow() -> NSWindow {
    let window = NSWindow(
      contentRect: NSRect.makeDefault(),
      styleMask: [.closable, .miniaturizable, .resizable, .fullSizeContentView],
      backing: .buffered, defer: false)
    window.level = .floating
    window.setFrameAutosaveName("everclock")
    window.collectionBehavior = [.canJoinAllSpaces, .stationary, .ignoresCycle, .fullScreenPrimary]
    window.makeKeyAndOrderFront(nil)
    window.isMovableByWindowBackground = true
    window.titleVisibility = .hidden
    window.backgroundColor = .clear
    return window
  }
}

class AppDelegate: NSObject, NSApplicationDelegate {
  var window = NSWindow.makeWindow()
  var hostingView: NSView?

  func applicationDidFinishLaunching(_ notification: Notification) {
    hostingView = NSHostingView(rootView: ClockView())
    window.contentView = hostingView
    NSApp.activate(ignoringOtherApps: true)
  }
}

extension NSRect {
  static func makeDefault() -> NSRect {
    let initialMargin = CGFloat(60)
    let fallback = NSRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 150)

    guard let screenFrame = NSScreen.main?.frame else {
      return fallback
    }

    return NSRect(
      x: screenFrame.maxX - fallback.width - initialMargin,
      y: screenFrame.maxY - fallback.height - initialMargin,
      width: fallback.width, height: fallback.height)
  }
}

extension NSMenu {
  static func makeMenu() -> NSMenu {
    let appMenu = NSMenuItem()
    appMenu.submenu = NSMenu()

    appMenu.submenu?.addItem(
      NSMenuItem(
        title: "Quit \(ProcessInfo.processInfo.processName)",
        action: #selector(NSApplication.terminate(_:)), keyEquivalent: "q"
      ))

    let mainMenu = NSMenu(title: "Main Menu")
    mainMenu.addItem(appMenu)
    return mainMenu
  }
}

[Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws) authors excellent Swift material at [hackingwithswift.com](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/). I regularly land on the site while searching for snippets from the browser. I was wondering if I could search for snippets directly from Emacs.

Turns out, hackingwithswift uses a JSON HTTP request for querying code examples. With this in mind, we can use *ivy-read* like Oleh Krehel's [counsel-search](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/blob/8d840b2e8680e2768edb794c9ccecf975f6ba4cf/counsel.el#L6680) and search for Swift snippets from our favorite editor:

# \[2020-05-23 Sat\] Preview SwiftUI layouts using Emacs org blocks

id: swiftui-layout-previews-using-emacs-org-blocks
---

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/swiftui-layout-previews-using-emacs-org-blocks/ob-swiftui.gif)

✨ *UPDATE: The snippets in this post are outdated. See [ob-swiftui](https://github.com/xenodium/ob-swiftui) for better SwiftUI babel support*. ✨

Chris Eidhof [twitted](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof/status/1261360332594974721) a handy [snippet](https://gist.github.com/chriseidhof/26768f0b63fa3cdf8b46821e099df5ff) that enables quickly bootstrapping throwaway SwiftUI code. It can be easily integrated into other tools for rapid experimentation.

Being a SwiftUI noob, I could use some SwiftUI integration with my editor of choice. With some elisp glue and a small patch, Chris's snippet can be used to generate SwiftUI inline previews using Emacs org babel. This is particularly handy for playing around with SwiftUI layouts.

We can piggyback ride off zweifisch's [ob-swift](https://github.com/zweifisch/ob-swift) by advicing *org-babel-execute:swift* to inject the org source block into the bootstrapping snippet. We also add a hook to *org-babel-after-execute-hook* to automatically refresh the inline preview.

If you're a [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package) user, the following snippet should make things fairly self-contained (if you have [melpa](https://melpa.org/) set up already).

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}

~~Snippet also at github [gist](https://gist.github.com/xenodium/79154033bc26e733b8c43af228cbce5b) and included in [my emacs config](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/master/emacs/features/fe-org.el)~~.

*UPDATE: See [ob-swiftui](https://github.com/xenodium/ob-swiftui) for a better version of babel SwiftUI support.*

Once the snippet is evaluated, we're ready to use in an org babel block. We introduced the *:swiftui* header param to switch between inline static *preview* and *interactive* mode.

To try out an inline *preview*, create a new org file (eg. swiftui.org) and a source block like:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/swiftui-layout-previews-using-emacs-org-blocks/vstack.jpg)

Place the cursor anywhere inside the source block (#+begin_src/#+end_src) and press C-c C-c (or M-x org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c).

To run interactively, change the *:swiftui* param to *interactive* and press C-c C-c (or M-x org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c). When running interactively, press "q" (without ⌘) to quit the Swift app.

## Update

-   Tweaked the snippet to make it more self-contained and made the steps more reproducible. Need to work out how to package things to make them more accessible. May be best to contribute as a patch to [ob-swift](https://github.com/zweifisch/ob-swift) and we can avoid the icky *advice-add*.
-   Thanks to Chris Eidhof for PNG support (instead of TIFF). Also TIL Swift's *print* has got a terminator param.

# \[2020-05-22 Fri\] Open Emacs elfeed links in the background
---
id: open-emacs-elfeed-links-in-background
---

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/open-emacs-elfeed-links-in-background/background-browse.gif)

Christopher Wellons's [elfeed](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed) is a wonderful Emacs rss reader. In Mike Zamansky's [Using Emacs 72 - Customizing Elfeed](https://cestlaz.github.io/post/using-emacs-72-customizing-elfeed/) video, he highlights a desire to open elfeed entries in the background. That is, open the current rss entry (or selected entries) without shifting focus from Emacs to your browser. This behaviour is somewhat analogous to ⌘-clicking/ctrl-clicking on multiple links in the browser without losing focus.

I've been wanting elfeed to open links in the background for some time. Zamansky's post was a great nudge to look into it. He points to the relevant [elfeed-search-browse-url](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed/blob/58ab1f8bcc3014206db42a7a26f3120ba5de4ca6/elfeed-search.el#L783) function, re-implemented to suit his needs. In a similar spirit, I wrote a function to open the current rss entry (or selected entries) in the background.

I'm running macOS, so I took a look at [browse-url-default-macosx-browser](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/d714aa753b744c903d149a1f6c69262d958c313e/lisp/net/browse-url.el#L1018  I ) to get an idea of how URLs are opened. Simple. It let's macOS handle it via the "open" command, invoked through *start process*. Looking at open's command-line options, we find *–background* which "does not bring the application to the foreground."

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
open --background http://xenodium.com
```

"b" is already bound to *elfeed-search-browse-url*, so in our snippet we'll bind "B" to our new background function, giving us some flexibility:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(use-package elfeed
  :ensure t
  :bind (:map elfeed-search-mode-map
              ("B" . ar/elfeed-search-browse-background-url))
  :config
  (defun ar/elfeed-search-browse-background-url ()
    "Open current `elfeed' entry (or region entries) in browser without losing focus."
    (interactive)
    (let ((entries (elfeed-search-selected)))
      (mapc (lambda (entry)
              (assert (memq system-type '(darwin)) t "open command is macOS only")
              (start-process (concat "open " (elfeed-entry-link entry))
                             nil "open" "--background" (elfeed-entry-link entry))
              (elfeed-untag entry 'unread)
              (elfeed-search-update-entry entry))
            entries)
      (unless (or elfeed-search-remain-on-entry (use-region-p))
        (forward-line)))))
```

Maybe xdg-open does a similar thing on linux (I've not looked). Ping me if you have a linux solution and I can update the function.

Happy Emacsing.

ps. I noticed elfeed uses *browse-url-generic* if *elfeed-search-browse-url*'s is invoked with a prefix. Setting [browse-url-generic-program](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/d0e2a341dd9a9a365fd311748df024ecb25b70ec/lisp/net/browse-url.el#L534) and [browse-url-generic-args](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/d0e2a341dd9a9a365fd311748df024ecb25b70ec/lisp/net/browse-url.el#L539) to use background options may be a more generic solution. For now, a custom function does the job.

# \[2020-05-11 Mon\] Enrich Emacs dired's batching toolbox
---
id: enrich-your-dired-batching-toolbox
---

## Update

I now use [dwim-shell-command](https://github.com/xenodium/dwim-shell-command), which reduces the logic to:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" lexical="no"}
(defun dwim-shell-commands-image-to-jpg ()
  "Convert all marked images to jpg(s)."
  (interactive)
  (dwim-shell-command-on-marked-files
   "Convert to jpg"
   "convert -verbose '<<f>>' '<<fne>>.jpg'"
   :utils "convert"))
```

## Original post

Shell one-liners are super handy for batch-processing files. Say you'd like to convert a bunch of images from HEIC to jpg, you could use something like:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
for f in *.HEIC ; do convert "$f" "${f%.*}.jpg"; done
```

Save the one-liner (or memorize it) and pull it from your toolbox next time you need it. This is handy as it is, but [Emacs dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html) is just a file-management powerhouse. Its *dired-map-over-marks* function is just a few elisp lines away from enabling all sorts of batch processing within your dired buffers.

Dired already enables selecting and deselecting files using all sorts of built-in mechanisms ([dired-mark-files-regexp](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Marks-vs-Flags.html), [find-name-dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired-and-Find.html), etc) or wonderful third-party packages like Matus Goljer's [dired-filters](https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks).

Regardless of how you selected your files, here's a snippet to run ImageMagick's [convert](https://imagemagick.org/script/convert.php) on a bunch of selected files:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
;;; -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

                                                      (string-equal format src-ext))
                                                    '("jpg" "png")))))
       (setq last-ext dst-ext)

        (if (string-equal system-type "windows-nt")
            (start-process "convert"
                           (generate-new-buffer (format "*convert %s*" (file-name-nondirectory src-fpath)))
                           "magick.exe" "convert" src-fpath dst-fpath)
          (start-process "convert"
                         (generate-new-buffer (format "*convert %s*" (file-name-nondirectory src-fpath)))
                         "convert" src-fpath dst-fpath))
        (lambda (process state)
          (if (= (process-exit-status process) 0)
              (message "convert %s ✔" (file-name-nondirectory dst-fpath))
            (message "convert %s ❌" (file-name-nondirectory dst-fpath))
            (message (with-current-buffer (process-buffer process)

          (kill-buffer (process-buffer process)))))
     (dired-map-over-marks (dired-get-filename) arg))))
```

The snippet can be shorter, but wouldn't be as friendly. We ask users to provide desired image format, spawn separate processes (avoids blocking Emacs), and generate a basic report. Also adds support for Windows.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/enrich-your-dired-batching-toolbox/batch-dired.gif)

## BEWARE

The snippet isn't currently capping the number of processes, but hey we can revise in the future…

## Update

Thanks to [Philippe Beliveau](https://github.com/pbeliveau) for pointing out a bug in snippet (now updated) and changes to make it Windows compatible.

# \[2020-05-06 Wed\] Emacs: connect my Bluetooth speaker
---
id: emacs-connect-my-bluetooth-speaker
---

Connecting and disconnecting bluetooth devices on macOS is fairly simple: use the menu bar utility.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-connect-my-bluetooth-speaker/macos-menu.png)

*But could we make it quicker from our beloved editor?*

Turns out with a little elisp glue, we can fuzzy search our Bluetooth devices and toggle connections. We can use [Oleh Krehel's](https://twitter.com/_abo_abo) [ivy-read](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) for fuzzy searching and [Felix Lapalme](https://twitter.com/lap_felix)'s nifty [BluetoothConnector](https://github.com/lapfelix/BluetoothConnector) to list devices and toggle Bluetooth connections.

As a bonus, we can make it remember the last selected device, so you can quickly toggle it again.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}

# \[2020-04-26 Sun\] Neapolitan pizza recipe
---
id: neapolitan-pizza-recipe
---

Full disclosure: I'm a complete noob at making pizza. It's my second pizza, but hey, it was tasty and fun to make! Making pizza at home is not as far-fetched as I initially thought.

## UPDATES:

I've made this recipe a couple of times. Made two improvements worth mentioning.

### Flan tin / quiche pan

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/round_pie.jpg)

My first pizzas were rectangular, matching the baking tray shape, but I really wanted round pies. I found a quiche pan at home and gave that a try. Worked pretty well. The dish bottom comes up, which is pretty handy.

### Double baking

Bake in two stages:

1.  Bake the pizza for 6 minutes (without the mozarella) at bottom of oven.
2.  Add mozzarella and make for 4 minutes at top of the oven.

## Recipe

Ok, on to the recipe now…

### Dissolve the yeast

-   7g of yeast.
-   325ml of lukewarm water.

Dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm water.

### Mixing the dough

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/mix1.jpg)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/mix2.jpg)

-   500g of flour.
-   1 teaspoon of salt.

Gradually add flour to the yeast and water mix, using the bottom of a spoon to work it until smooth (no lumps). The dough will be very sticky at first. Stay faithful to the spoon. It'll work. BBC's [How to make pizza like a Neapolitan master](http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200415-how-to-make-pizza-like-a-neapolitan-master) has a great demo. I followed the dough technique.

### Kneading the dough

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/knead1.jpg)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/knead2.jpg)

Sprinkle some flour on the table and knead the dough (punch, stretch, and fold many times) from previous step. Eventually, the dough will hold its shape.

### Make 4 balls

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/cut_in_four.jpg)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/four_balls.jpg)

Roll the dough into a cylinder and cut into 4 pieces. Make 4 balls.

### Make the tomato sauce

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/garlic_slice.jpg)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/sauce_done.jpg)

-   500g of passata.
-   3 cloves of garlic.

I love garlic. Who doesn't? Slice the garlic finely and combine with the passata in a class jar. Shake it a little. Garlic and passata. That's your sauce.

### Cover for 2 hours

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/put_away.jpg)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/after_hours.jpg)

Place the 4 dough balls into a container and cover with a damp cloth for 2 hours. You can make 4 pizzas.

*\*Rookie mistake: I should have used a bigger container. The balls grew and merged.*

### Preheat oven

Preheat the oven at 250°C.

### Stretch base

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/stretch.jpg)

Sprinkle more flour on table prior to shaping the dough. Place ball on table, flatten. Flip over, flatten again. Gradually stretch until you have the shape and thickness desired.

### Place base on baking tray

-   Semolina
-   Aluminium foil

Line up the tray with some aluminium foil. Before transferring the base on to the baking tray, sprinkle semolina (or breadcrumbs) on the foil (it helps prevent the dough from sticking).

### Toppings

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/oiled.jpg)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/parmesan.jpg)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/mozarella.jpg)

-   Tomato sauce.
-   Salt.
-   Olive oil.
-   Parmesan cheese.
-   125g of Mozzarella cheese.
-   Fresh basil.

Spread some of the tomato sauce with a spoon. Sprinkle salt, olive oil, and parmesan cheese. Break the mozzarella into pieces and spread throughout. Add some basil leaves. Your basic margherita pizza is now ready for the oven.

### Bake pizza

Place the tray in the oven for 10 minutes. This worked for my oven, which goes up to 250°C. Either way, keep an eye on it.

### Post baking toppings

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/neapolitan-pizza-recipe/final.jpg)

-   Anchovies.

Controversial, but I really like anchovies. Add them post-baking and you're good to go. Enjoy your pizza.

---

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/oatmeal-cookie-recipe/oatcookies.jpg)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/oatmeal-cookie-recipe/ingredients.jpg)

I combined elements from two recipes: [3 Ingredient oatmeal cookies (The Food Medic)](https://thefoodmedic.co.uk/2020/01/3-ingredient-oatmeal-cookies/), Amy's [Healthy Banana Oatmeal Raisin Cookies (Amy's Healthy Baking)](https://amyshealthybaking.com/blog/2018/01/21/banana-oatmeal-raisin-cookies/) and added my own touches.

## Preheat oven

Preheat the oven at 180°C.

## Mash bananas

-   2 medium ripe bananas.

Mash until bananas have no significant lumps.

## Mix most ingredients (except oats)

-   4 tablespoons crunchy peanut butter.
-   1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
-   1/2 teaspoon of ground cardamom.
-   1/4 teaspoon of vanilla.
-   1/3 cup raisins.

Add the peanut butter, cinnamon, cardamom, and vanilla into the mashed bananas. Mix well. Add raisins and mix a little further to spread them out.

## Add oats

-   1 3/4 cups of oats.

Add the oats to the mix in a few rounds to ensure its evenly mixed.

## Flattened balls in tray

Make balls, place on baking tray, and gently flatten. They'll be on the chunky side.

*Note: They won't spread as much as traditional cookies.*

## Bake for 15 mins

Bake for about 15 minutes or until golden.

## Let cool off and enjoy

Wait a little and nom nom nom…

About a week ago, I built and installed its [pre-release version (1.3.10)](https://github.com/djcb/mu/releases/tag/1.3.10) and noted [build steps on macOS](http://xenodium.com/building-mumu4e-on-macos/). It's been working great for me. Today, I updated to 1.4.

I was keen to try the new release out. I had been experiencing a short delay immediately after syncing/indexing mail. An initial investigation pointed to contact syncing, but I didn't dig further. The 1.4 release notes had a promising entry:

> In many cases, \`mu4e' used to receive *all* contacts after each indexing operation; this was slow for some users, so we have updated this to *only* get the contacts that have changed since the last round.

After upgrading. The delay is gone for me ø/

**Note**: there are a few config tweaks needed for the 1.4 upgrade, but these are well-documented in the [release notes](https://github.com/djcb/mu/releases/tag/1.4). For me, it primarily consisted of:

-   Swapping elisp *mu4e-maildir* var for *mu init –maildir path/to/local/IMAP*.
-   Swapping elisp *mu4e-user-mail-address-list* for *mu init –my-address address1@domain.com –my-address address2@domain.com*.
-   Disabling *mu4e-maildirs-extension* (not yet compatible with mu 1.4). No issues here, since I hardly ever look at the *mu4e-main* buffer. I have global binding to my unread messages that looks a little something like this:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(defun ar/mu4e-view-unread-messages ()
  (interactive)
  (mu4e-headers-search-bookmark (concat "flag:unread AND "
                                        "flag:unread AND "
                                        "NOT flag:trashed AND "
                                        "(maildir:/box1/INBOX OR "
                                        "maildir:/box2/INBOX)")))
```

# \[2020-04-06 Mon\] Emacs's counsel-M-x meets multiple cursors
---
id: emacss-counsel-m-x-meets-multiple-cursors
---

I'm a fan of Magnar Sveen's [multiple cursors](https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el) Emacs implementation. It's just so fun to use and works very well with commands bound to my favorite keys.

Every now and then I'd like to execute extended commands on all cursors, but they have no keys bound to them. If you're an [ivy/counsel](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) fan like me (and all packages by [Abo Abo](https://oremacs.com/about/)), you use *counsel-M-x* to invoke commands. However, *counsel-M-x* doesn't support multiple cursors out of the box. Luckily, this is Emacs and we can fix that…

Back in December 2019, I made a note to revisit [u/snippins1987](https://www.reddit.com/user/snippins1987/)'s weekly tip to pair [helm-M-x with multiple cursors](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/eeyhdz/weekly_tipstricketc_thread/fch1bkv?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). Finally got back to it. With a few changes, we can also make the snippet work with *counsel-M-x* ø/.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(defun adviced:counsel-M-x-action (orig-fun &rest r)
  "Additional support for multiple cursors."
  (apply orig-fun r)
  (let ((cmd (intern (car r))))
    (when (and (boundp 'multiple-cursors-mode)
               multiple-cursors-mode
               cmd
               (not (memq cmd mc--default-cmds-to-run-once))
               (not (memq cmd mc/cmds-to-run-once))
               (or mc/always-run-for-all
                   (memq cmd mc--default-cmds-to-run-for-all)
                   (memq cmd mc/cmds-to-run-for-all)
                   (mc/prompt-for-inclusion-in-whitelist cmd)))
      (mc/execute-command-for-all-fake-cursors cmd))))

[string-inflection](https://github.com/akicho8/string-inflection) (by [Akira Ikeda](https://github.com/akicho8)) is a nifty package to cycle through string case styles: [camel, snake, kebab…](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles) The package includes a handful of cycling functions for different languages (Ruby, Python and Java), but it's easy to mix and match to roll your own. For now, I'm binding *C-M-j* to *string-inflection-cycle*, which is an alias to *string-inflection-ruby-style-cycle*.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}

id: dal-makhani-black-lentils-recipe
---

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/dal-makhani-black-lentils-recipe/dal.jpg)

## Soak beans (overnight)

-   1 cup of rajmah (kidney beans).
-   2 cups of sabut urad (black lentils).

Place the beans in a bowl with plenty of water. The beans will soak it up so ensure there's enough.

## Cooking the beans

-   3 liters of water.
-   1 cinamon stick.
-   1 tablespoon of turmeric.
-   2 bay leaves.

Drain the beans and combine new ingredients into a pot. Bring to a boil and simer for 1.5 hours. Check beans aren't firm (give 'em a try'). If so extend another 15-30 mins.

## Prepare paste

-   1 4 cm piece of ginger.
-   1 large onion.
-   6 garlic cloves.
-   2 tomatoes.

Put through blender (with choppin pulse) or food processor until you get a paste.

## Golden paste

-   Paste.
-   3 tablespoons of butter.
-   1 tablespoon of cumin seeds.
-   1 tablespoon of coriander powder.
-   1 tablespoon of chilly powder (or less to make milder).
-   1 fresh red hot pepper (find one with medium heat level) chopped.
-   1 tablespoon of cumin powder.
-   1/4 cup of water.
-   3/4 tablespoon of salt.

Heat up the butter (medium heat) and brown the cumin seeds (maybe 30 seconds). Add the paste from previous step. Cook for about 4 minutes or until golden. Add the remaining ingredients in step (except water) and cook for another 30 seconds. Add the water and salt and mix to make more fluid and remove from heat.

## Tying it all together

-   1 tablespoon of panchpuram (cumin, fenugreek, mistard, and fennel seeds).
-   300 ml of double cream.

Combine the cooked beans, golden paste, and seeds. Simmer for about 15 minutes. Add the cream and cook for about 2 minutes. You are effectively done.

## Garnish (optional)

You can serve and optionally garnish with some chopped coriander. Recommended.

## Serve with

Basmati rice, rotis, buttered buns, or even corn tortillas (unorthodox, but hey).

# \[2020-03-21 Sat\] Modern Emacs lisp libraries
---
id: modern-elisp-libraries
---

Quickly finding related built-in elisp functions (without prefixes) can sometimes take a little poking around.

Some modern and predictable built-in exceptions I now reach out to are:

-   [map.el](https://nicolas.petton.fr/ressources/emacsconf2015/) for key/values, alists, hash-tables and arrays (built-in as of Emacs 25.1).
-   [seq.el](https://nicolas.petton.fr/ressources/emacsconf2015/) for sequence manipulation functions (built-in as of Emacs 25.1).
-   [subr-x.el](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/emacs-lisp/subr-x.el) has a handful of string functions (built-in as of Emacs 24.4).
-   [let-alist.el](https://endlessparentheses.com/new-on-elpa-and-in-emacs-25-1-let-alist.html) wonderful syntax for alists, great for json (built-in as of Emacs 25.1).

If you don't mind reaching out to third-party libs (you likely have some of these already installed), here are some modern, predictable, and well-documented ones that always get me out of trouble:

-   [s.el](https://github.com/magnars/s.el#functions) string manipulation.
-   [f.el](https://github.com/rejeep/f.el) file/path handling.
-   [dash.el](https://github.com/magnars/dash.el#functions) for lists.
-   [ht.el](https://github.com/Wilfred/ht.el) for hashtables.
-   [ts.el](https://github.com/alphapapa/ts.el) for date and time.

I'm happy with built-ins like map.el, seq.el, and let-alist.el. subr-x.el is also pretty nice, although not as full-featured as third-party s.el.

Am I missing out on other modern built-ins or third-party libraries?

UPDATE: Added a handful of newly discovered libraries plus [suggestions by Daniel Martín](https://twitter.com/dmartincy/status/1241444701754085383?s=20) (thanks!). Not tried any of these myself.

-   [rtree.el](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/rtree.el) binary tree that stores ranges (Built-in).
-   [ov.el](https://github.com/emacsorphanage/ov) simple way to manipulate overlay.
-   Toby Cubitt's [libraries](http://www.dr-qubit.org/tags/computing-code-emacs.html) (heap, overlays, queue, avl-tree, trie, dict-tree, etc).
-   [shadchen.el](https://github.com/VincentToups/shadchen-el) pattern-matching.
-   [m-buffer.el](https://phillord.github.io/m-buffer-el) buffers.
-   [esxml.el](https://github.com/tali713/esxml) xml and html.
-   [a.el](https://github.com/plexus/a.el) associative structures.
-   [asoc.el](https://github.com/troyp/asoc.el) association list library.
-   [yk-color.el](https://github.com/yurikhan/yk-color) linear RGB color manipulation.

# \[2020-03-20 Fri\] Emacs smartparens auto-indent
---
id: emacs-smartparens-auto-indent
---

While I do most editing in Emacs, I use Xcode every now and then. I like Xcode's pair matching (of brackets) combined with its auto-indent.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-smartparens-auto-indent/xcode_indent.gif)

While the wonderful [smartparens](https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens) gives Emacs pair-matching powers, it doesn't automatically indent between pairs (out of the box anyway).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-smartparens-auto-indent/indent_bracket_before.gif)

Luckily, smartparens does provide *sp-local-pair,* which enables us to achieve a similar goal.

With a short snippet, we can autoindent between {}, \[\], and () when pressing return in-between.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(defun indent-between-pair (&rest _ignored)
  (newline)
  (indent-according-to-mode)
  (forward-line -1)
  (indent-according-to-mode))

(sp-local-pair 'prog-mode "{" nil :post-handlers '((indent-between-pair "RET")))
(sp-local-pair 'prog-mode "[" nil :post-handlers '((indent-between-pair "RET")))
(sp-local-pair 'prog-mode "(" nil :post-handlers '((indent-between-pair "RET")))
```

# \[2019-12-29 Sun\] Fixing Honeywell CM927's dead screen
---
id: fixing-honeywell-cm927-dead-screens
---

My Honeywell CM927 thermostat's screen had been getting progressively worse over the last year. As of late, the screen was of little use.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/fixing-honeywell-cm927-dead-screens/before.png)

A random search yielded the [Honeywell CM927 LCD screen fail - common?](https://www.homeownershub.com/uk-diy/honeywell-cm927-lcd-screen-fail-common-1058940-.htm) thread, with a promising comment by Phil:

> "Strip the unit and remove the circuit board (just a few plastic clips, no screws). Remove the LCD assembly from the circuit board (more plastic clips and an eight pin push connection). Removed the LCD unit from the clear plastic housing (more plastic clips). Finally heat up the plastic ribbon where it is stuck to the circuit board (hair dryer will do trick) and then firmly press it onto the circuit board… probably worth doing this several times; in effect you are remating the ribbon to the circuit board by softening the adhesive. Put it all back together and it should be working again."

Phil's instructions were great. There's also a super handy [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4LxHn5Y_l4) by [El Tucan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3Dbv6X-_7fCfa4AvsxK_zw), also [linked by Stevie](https://www.homeownershub.com/uk-diy/honeywell-cm927-lcd-screen-fail-common-1058940-3.htm).

## Success ø/

Heating up the plastic ribbon and pressing it onto the circuit board did the trick for me. Took a few tries for all segments to appear, but the screen is looking great again.

Thank you Internet strangers! :)

# \[2019-12-17 Tue\] Studying for Life in the UK test
---
id: studying-for-life-in-the-uk-test
---

Today, I passed the [Life in the UK test](https://www.gov.uk/life-in-the-uk-test). Wasn't quite sure how to study for it. During my commutes, I listened to the [Life in the UK 2019 Test audio book](https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Life-in-the-UK-2019-Test-Contains-the-Official-Course-300-Practice-Questions-Audiobook/B07VD9SR3L).

A friend recommended [lifeintheuktestweb.co.uk](https://lifeintheuktestweb.co.uk). Overall, I found their practice tests very useful. Taking a bunch tests helped me internalize the material.

Took some notes along the way (mostly data with years attached) and dumped it into an [org table](https://orgmode.org/manual/Built_002din-Table-Editor.html#Built_002din-Table-Editor). This helped me form a mental timeline.

**NOTE:** *These tables alone are **not** comprehensive enough to prepare for the exam. You'll need to know additional information without dates attached.*

# \[2019-11-24 Sun\] Wizard zines comics in Emacs eshell
---
id: wizard-zines-comics-eshell-util
---

Over at [wizardzines.com](http://wizardzines.com), [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca) authors wonderful zines on topics like git, networking, linux, command-line utilities, and others. Some zines are paid. Some are free. No affiliation here, just a fan.

A little while ago, Julia [tweeted](https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1192304892435738624) about a utility she's building to view her original comics on similar topics. I instantly thought it'd be a fun tool to implement for Emacs [eshell](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html).

Since then, I subscribed to [wizardzines.com/saturday-comics](https://wizardzines.com/saturday-comics/) and received a few comics (awk, tar, and bash tricks). I saved them locally (using topic name and dropping file extensions).

``` {.bash org-language="sh" exports="both"}
ls -1 ~/Downloads/wizardzines-comics/
```

  ------
  awk
  bash
  tar
  ------

By no means battle-tested, but here's an elisp snippet defining the *ecomic* command. It displays inlined comics in the handy eshell.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(require 'eshell)
(require 'iimage)

(defvar wizardzines-comics-path "~/Downloads/wizardzines-comics")

(defun eshell/ecomic (&rest args)
  "Display command comic in ARGS.
Note: ensure comic images live in `wizardzines-comics-path', named with
command name and no extension."
  (eshell-eval-using-options
   "ecomic" args
   '((?h "help" nil nil "show this usage screen")
     :external "ecomic"
     :show-usage
     :usage "COMMAND

Show COMMAND comic from Julia Evans' https://wizardzines.com/saturday-comics")
   (let* ((command (nth 0 (eshell-stringify-list (eshell-flatten-list args))))
          (image-fpath (concat (file-name-as-directory
                                (expand-file-name wizardzines-comics-path))
                               command)))
     (unless (file-exists-p image-fpath)
       (error "comic: \"%s\" not found :-(" command))
     (eshell-buffered-print "\n")
     (add-text-properties 0 (length image-fpath)
                          `(display ,(create-image image-fpath)
                                    modification-hooks
                                    (iimage-modification-hook))
                          image-fpath)
     (eshell-buffered-print image-fpath)
     (eshell-flush))))

# \[2019-11-21 Thu\] Emacs counsel default search switches
---
id: emacs-counsel-default-search-switches
---

Following up from [Enhanced Emacs searching with counsel switches](http://xenodium.com/enhanced-emacs-searching-with-counsel-switches), rather than remembering [silver searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) and [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) switches, we can use [counsel's](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) *ivy-initial-inputs-alist* to set these up as default visible switches.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(push '(counsel-ag . "--file-search-regex '' -- ") ivy-initial-inputs-alist)
(push '(counsel-rg . "--glob '**' -- ") ivy-initial-inputs-alist)
```

The default switches stay out of the way in typical searches, but can be easily modified to include (or exclude) results matching specific file *names*.

The [counsel](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) family of Emacs search commands are great for searching the filesystem. More specifically, *counsel-rg*, *counsel-ag*, and *counsel-pt*, which use the popular [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), [silver searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher), and [platinum searcher](https://github.com/monochromegane/the_platinum_searcher) utilities.

counsel-rg is my default searcher. It returns results quickly, with live updates as I tweak the search query.

Up until recently, my queries typically matched text in files only. This works great, but every so often I wished I could amend the query to include (or exclude) results matching specific file *names*. Turns out, you can prepend the search query with additional switches using the "–" separator.

The switches are usually utility-specific, but if we wanted to keep results from file names matching a glob, we can prepend the ripgrep query with something like *"–glob Make\* –"* or the shorter version *"-g Make\* –"*.

rg: -g Make\* – install

# \[2019-11-10 Sun\] Emacs org block company completion
---
id: emacs-org-block-company-completion
---

UPDATE: This is now available [on melpa](https://melpa.org/#/company-org-block).

Back in 2015, I bound the "\<" key to a hydra for quickly inserting org blocks. The idea came from Oleg's post on [org-mode block templates in Hydra](https://oremacs.com/2015/03/07/hydra-org-templates/). The suggested binding settled in my muscle memory without much effort.

Fast forward to Febrary 2019. I replaced the hydra with *[org-insert-structure-template](https://orgmode.org/manual/Easy-templates.html)* when *org-try-structure-completion* was removed from org mode. No biggie, as I kept the same binding to "\<" and hardly noticed the change.

Since my primary use-case for easy templates is inserting [source blocks](https://orgmode.org/manual/Working-with-source-code.html), I was keen to expedite choosing the source language as well as inserting the source block itself.

Writing a small [company mode](https://company-mode.github.io/) completion backend fits my primary use-case pretty well.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-org-block-company-completion/company-org-block.gif)

The company backend looks as follow (**Warning:** [Snippet needs Org v9.2](https://twitter.com/tpanum/status/1197772426072997888)).

Note: This code is not up to date. Install via [melpa](https://melpa.org/#/company-org-block) or see [its repository](https://github.com/xenodium/company-org-block).

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" results="value"}

                                     ;; Take the first one.
                                     (nth 0 (split-string insertion)))
    (company-org-block--wrap-point (format "src %s" insertion)
                                   "src")))

(defun company-org-block--wrap-point (begin end)
  "Wrap point with block using BEGIN and END.  For example:

  (insert (format "#+begin_%s\n" begin))
  (insert (make-string org-edit-src-content-indentation ?\s))
  ;; Saving excursion restores point to location inside code block.
  (save-excursion
    (insert (format "\n#+end_%s" end))))

(defun company-org-block--grab-symbol-cons ()
  "Return cons with symbol and t whenever prefix of < is found.
For example: \"<e\" -> (\"e\" . t)"
  (when (looking-back (if company-org-block-bol-p
                          (concat "^" company-org--regexp)
                        company-org--regexp)
                      (line-beginning-position))
    (cons (match-string-no-properties 1) t)))
```

To use, add the backend enable *company-mode* in *org-mode*:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" results="value"}
(add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-org-block)
(company-mode +1)
```

## Updates

-   Removed language-specific header logic (use *[org-babel-default-header-args](https://www.orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/header-args.html)* instead).
-   Also completes non-source block templates from [org-structure-template-alist](https://orgmode.org/manual/Easy-templates.html).
-   Source in my [dot files](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/master/emacs/ar/company-org-block.el).
-   Removed unnecessary binding. Just add company backend as usual.
-   Thanks to [Takaaki Ishikawa](https://twitter.com/takaxp) for [suggesting \`org-edit-src-content-indentation'](https://twitter.com/takaxp/status/1195884481535561729?s=20).
-   Thanks to [Thomas Kobber](https://twitter.com/tpanum) for [highlighting incompatibility](https://twitter.com/xenodium/status/1194224168709083137) with older org versions.

# \[2019-11-03 Sun\] A more reusable Emacs shell-command history
---
id: more-reusable-emacs-shell-command-history
---

[Cameron Desautel](https://twitter.com/camdez) has a great post on [Working Faster in Emacs by Reading the "Future"](https://engineering.collbox.co/post/working-faster-in-emacs-by-reading-the-future/), highlighting *M-n*'s usefulness for inserting minibuffer default values.

Invoking *M-n* in *shell-command*'s prompt is handy for quickly getting the current buffer's file name. This works great for one-off shell commands like *"chmod +x script.sh"* or *"tidy -xml -i -m data.xml"*. Unfortunately, these commands aren't easily reusable from *shell-command*'s minibuffer history, since it'll keep hardcoded file names.

There's likely existing built-in functionality or a more elaborate package for this, but advising *read-shell-command* enables us to write more reusable commands like *"chmod +x \$f"* or *"tidy -xml -i -m \$f".* We merely replace *\$f* with *(buffer-file-name)*, and let everything else continue as usual.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/more-reusable-emacs-shell-command-history/expanded-shell-command.png)

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(defun ar/adviced-read-shell-command (orig-fun &rest r)
  "Advice around `read-shell-command' to replace $f with buffer file name."
  (let ((command (apply orig-fun r)))
    (if (string-match-p "\\$f" command)
        (replace-regexp-in-string "\\$f"
                                  (or (buffer-file-name)
                                      (user-error "No file file visited to replace $f"))
                                  command)
      command)))

(advice-add 'read-shell-command
            :around
            'ar/adviced-read-shell-command)
```

It's worth mentioning that searching minibuffer history is pretty simple when leveraging [counsel](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) to fuzzy search (via *counsel-minibuffer-history*, bound to *C-r* by default).

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/more-reusable-emacs-shell-command-history/richer-shell-command-history.gif)

On a final note, searching minibuffer history for cache hits is way more useful with richer history content. Be sure to save minibuffer history across Emacs sessions and increase *shell-command-history* using the built-in [savehist-mode](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SaveHist).

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(use-package savehist
  :custom
  (savehist-file "~/.emacs.d/savehist")
  (savehist-save-minibuffer-history t)
  (history-length 10000)
  (savehist-additional-variables
   '(shell-command-history))
  :config
  (savehist-mode +1))
```

# \[2019-10-10 Thu\] Emacs swiper and multiple cursors
---
id: emacs-swiper-and-multiple-cursors
---

Emacs [swiper](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) is awesome. I bound *swiper-isearch* to *C-s*. Also a big fan of [multiple cursors](https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el). I use it regularly (it's fun).

I had totally missed Ole's post back in 2015: [A simple multiple-cursors extension to swiper](https://oremacs.com/2015/10/14/swiper-mc/). Turns out, swiper has multiple cursors support out of the box (bound to *C-7* by default). Yay!

UPDATE: Thanks to [irreal's post](https://irreal.org/blog/?p=8370), please remember to add *swiper-mc* to *mc/cmds-to-run-once* list (or things won't work as expected). This typically happens interactively when you invoke C-7 the first time around. Make sure you answer "n" when you see a prompt like:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-swiper-and-multiple-cursors/swiper-mc-no.png)

If you happen to choose "y" by mistake, take a look at **\~/.emacs.d/.mc-lists.el** to correct it. Remove *swiper-mc* from *mc/cmds-to-run-for-all* and add it to *mc/cmds-to-run-once*. Invoke *m-x eval-buffer* to reset the values and you're good to go.

# \[2019-10-08 Tue\] Spam blacklisting with Emacs org babel
---
id: spam-blacklisting-with-emacs-org-babel
---

Some email provider accept regular expressions to blacklist additional spam. My blacklist is long and tedious to update, but hey… Emacs org babel can simplify things here.

It's way easier to maintain a blacklist (with no regex) using an org table.

## Blacklist

and subsequently use org babel (elisp snippet) to generate the regex.

## Regex gen

UPDATE: Tweaked elisp and regex (but not animation) also found John Bokma's post: [Blacklisting domains with Postfix](http://johnbokma.com/blog/2019/05/13/blacklisting-domains-with-postfix.html).

# \[2019-10-06 Sun\] Rewriting dates with Emacs multiple cursors
---
id: rewriting-dates-with-emacs-multiple-cursors
---

Needed to rewrite the date format in a couple of csv columns. Emacs multiple cursors helps here, but needed a function to parse and reformat the dates themselves.

I can likely reformat dates using the built-in *parse-time-string* and *format-time-string* functions, but hey why not give the [ts.el](https://github.com/alphapapa/ts.el) library a try…

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(defun ar/region-to-timestamp ()
  "Convert date like \"29 Apr 2019\" to \"2019-04-29\"."
  (interactive)
  (let ((date (ts-parse (buffer-substring
                         (region-beginning)
                         (region-end)))))
    (delete-region (region-beginning)
                   (region-end))
    (insert (ts-format "%Y-%m-%d" date))))
```

Bound the new function to a temporary keybinding, so I can invoke from multiple cursors:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(bind-key "M-q" #'ar/region-to-timestamp)
```

and voilà!

# \[2019-10-05 Sat\] Show/hide Emacs dired details in style
---
id: showhide-emacs-dired-details-in-style
---

Emacs [dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html) is a powerful directory browser/editor. By default, it shows lots of handy file and directory details.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/showhide-emacs-dired-details-in-style/dired.png)

I typically prefer hiding file and directory details until I need them. The built-in [dired-hide-details-mode](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Misc-Dired-Features.html) makes this easy with the "(" key toggle. Coupled with [Steve Purcell](https://twitter.com/sanityinc)'s [diredfl](https://github.com/purcell/diredfl) (for coloring), it strikes a great user experience.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/showhide-emacs-dired-details-in-style/diredfl.gif)

With a short snippet, you can also show/hide dired details in style:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(use-package dired
  :hook (dired-mode . dired-hide-details-mode)
  :config
  ;; Colourful columns.
  (use-package diredfl
    :ensure t
    :config
    (diredfl-global-mode 1)))
```

**UPDATE:** Thanks to [Daniel Martín](https://twitter.com/dmartincy), who [pointed me](https://twitter.com/dmartincy/status/1180512330288975872) to [dired-git-info](https://github.com/clemera/dired-git-info). This package adds git logs to dired file and directory details.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/showhide-emacs-dired-details-in-style/dired-git-info.gif)

Binding *dired-git-info-mode* to ")" is a nice complement to *dired-hide-details-mode*'s "(" binding.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(use-package dired-git-info
    :ensure t
    :bind (:map dired-mode-map
                (")" . dired-git-info-mode)))

# \[2019-05-04 Sat\] Batch file renaming with counsel, find-dired, and wdired
---
id: batch-renaming-with-counsel-find-dired-and-wdired
---

The first time I saw [wdired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Wdired.html) in action, it blew my mind. wdired makes [dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html#Dired) (directory editor) buffers writeable, so you can edit them like any other Emacs buffer. You can subsequently use all your favorite file-editing tricks to rename files (amongst other things). You can see it in action at the end of [Emacs Rocks episode 16](http://emacsrocks.com/e16.html).

When combining [find-dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired-and-Find.html) with wdired, one can easily find matching files and quickly batch rename them using something like [multiple cursors](https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el) or [keyboard macros](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Keyboard-Macros.html). I've been a fan of the *find-dired* -\> *dired-toggle-read-only* -\> *mc/mark-all-like-this* workflow for quite some time, but I always wished I could adjust *find-dired* queries a little quicker by getting immediate feedback.

Completion frontends like [ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) and [helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm) are perfect for getting this kind of immediate feedback. Peeking into ivy's [counsel source](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/blob/master/counsel.el), I borrowed some ideas to glue counsel-style narrowing on a find command, which I can easily translate to a writeable dired buffer for all that joyful-mutiple-cursor-editing experience.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/batch-renaming-with-counsel-find-dired-and-wdired/counsel-find.gif)

The code for *ar/counsel-find* is a little rough but can be found at [here](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/blob/master/emacs/ar/ar-counsel-find.el).

# \[2019-04-16 Tue\] Mark region, indent, restore location
---
id: mark-region-indent-restore-location
---

When I'm not using an automatic code formatter (ie. clang-format, gofmt, etc.), I often find myself using Emacs region marking commands like *mark-defun*, *er/expand-region*, and *mark-whole-buffer* prior to pressing \<tab\>, which is bound to *indent-for-tab-command*.

This is all working as expected: the selection gets indented and the point is left in the current location.

Say we have the following snippet we'd like to indent.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/mark-region-indent-restore-location/before.png)

Mark region with C-M-h (mark-defun)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/mark-region-indent-restore-location/selection.png)

Indent with \<tab\> (indent-for-tab-command)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/mark-region-indent-restore-location/basic-indent.png)

We're done. The selected function is now indented as expected.

But… I always wished the point returned to the location prior to initiating the region-marking command, in this case *mark-defun*.

In short, I wish the point had ended in the following location.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/mark-region-indent-restore-location/smart-indent.png)

I'm not aware of an existing package that helps with this, so here's a tiny minor mode (divert-mode) to help with restoring point location after indenting a region. The *diverted-events* variable can be used to track specific region selecting commands and associate breadcrumb functions to replace the point location as needed.

# \[2019-03-16 Sat\] No Emacs frame refocus on macOS
---
id: no-emacs-frame-refocus-on-macos

This one's been bugging me for a while. On macOS, Emacs automatically focuses (raises) other frames when one is closed.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/no-emacs-frame-refocus-on-macos/before.gif)

This has the unfortunate side-effect that I could be moved from one macOS desktop/space to another when closing an Emacs frame.

Finally managed do something about it. Since I install Emacs on macOS via homebrew, a ~~[small patch on emacs-plus recipe](https://github.com/xenodium/homebrew-emacs-plus/commit/79a8e98b222fa262746f6db620ddd1fdb151ece9)~~ [small patch on emacs-plus recipe](https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus/pull/122/commits/71bf246930bfedb337bcc0e21587ccbbb917e5bf) did the job.

[Marcin Borkowski](https://twitter.com/marcin_mbork) has a nice [tip](http://mbork.pl/2019-02-24_Transferring_strings_to_a_phone_via_QR_codes) to quickly copy text or URLs between desktop and mobile using QR codes.

Wrote a little elisp to do a similar thing using the clipboard via Emacs:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(defun ar/misc-clipboard-to-qr ()
  "Convert text in clipboard to qrcode and display within Emacs."
  (interactive)
  (let ((temp-file (concat (temporary-file-directory) "qr-code")))
    (if (eq 0 (shell-command (format "qrencode -s10 -o %s %s"
                                     temp-file
                                     (shell-quote-argument (current-kill 0)))
                             "*qrencode*"))
        (switch-to-buffer (find-file-noselect temp-file t))
      (error "Error: Could not create qrcode, check *qrencode* buffer"))))
```

ps. [Encoding your WiFi access point password into a QR code](https://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/posts/encoding-wifi-access-point-passwords-qr-code/) shows how to encode WiFi access point passwords:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
qrencode -o wifi.png "WIFI:T:WPA;S:<SSID>;P:<PASSWORD>;;"
```

More comprehensively:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}

pwgen -s 63 > 00wifi.txt
qrencode -o 00wifi.png "WIFI:T:WPA;S:${SSID};P:$(cat 00wifi.txt);;"

Ensure the reference time ("Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 -0700 MST 2006") is used in layout string.

For example:

``` {.go results="verbatim" exports="both"}

func main() {
        goodLayout := "January 2 2006"

        badLayout := "January 2 2009"

# \[2019-01-13 Sun\] Swapping Emacs ivy collections/sources

id: swapping-emacs-ivy-collectionssources

[Ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) is great. I've been meaning to figure out a way to swap sources while running ivy. This would enable me to cycle through different sources using the existing search parameters.

At first look, *'ivy-set-sources* seemed like the right choice, but it's used during setup to agregate sources. Subsequent *'ivy-set-sources* calls are ignored during an *'ivy-read* session.

There's an ivy [feature request](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper/issues/606) over at github with a similar goal in mind. Although the feature is not yet supported, there's a handy suggestion to use *'ivy-quit-and-run* to quit the current command and run a different one.

With *'ivy-quit-and-run* in mind, we can write our *'ar/ivy-read* function to take a list of sources and add a little logic to cycle through them using a keybiding, in my case \<left\> and \<right\>.

# \[2019-01-12 Sat\] Emacs on macOS Mojave

Had issues running Emacs on macOS Mojave (blank unresponsive screen). Bleeding edge emacs-plus did the job:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}

brew install emacs-plus --without-spacemacs-icon --HEAD
```

``` {.bash org-language="sh" results="verbatim" exports="both"}

--natural-title-bar option was removed from this formula, in order to
  duplicate its effect add following line to your init.el file
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-transparent-titlebar . t))
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-appearance . dark))
or:
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-transparent-titlebar . t))
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-appearance . light))

If you are using macOS Mojave, please note that most of the experimental
options are forbidden on Mojave. This is temporary decision.


To have launchd start d12frosted/emacs-plus/emacs-plus now and restart at login:
  brew services start d12frosted/emacs-plus/emacs-plus
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  emacs

# \[2019-01-06 Sun\] Trying out Emacs pdf tools

id: trying-out-emacs-pdf-tools

Late to the party, giving [pdf-tools](https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools) a try.

The [macOS install instructions](https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools#compiling-on-os-x) have a prerequisite:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install poppler automake
```

Installed with:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(use-package pdf-tools
  :ensure t
  :mode ("\\.pdf\\'" . pdf-view-mode)
  :config
  (pdf-tools-install)
  (setq-default pdf-view-display-size 'fit-page)
  (setq pdf-annot-activate-created-annotations t))
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/trying-out-emacs-pdf-tools/pdf-tools.png)

ps. (pdf-tools-install) may not find libffi on macOS. Try:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(setenv "PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
        (f-join
         (file-name-as-directory
          (nth 0

# \[2018-12-25 Tue\] Using OCR to create searchable pdfs from images
---
id: using-ocr-to-create-searchable-pdfs-from-images
---

Used my phone to take a handful of photos of an article from a magazine. Wanted to convert the images to a searchable pdf on macOS.

This was straightforward, having [already installed tesseract](http://xenodium.com/trying-out-tesseract).

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
for i in IMG_3*.jpg; do echo $i; tesseract $i $(basename $i .tif) pdf; done
```

Should now have a handful of OCR'd pdfs:

``` {.bash org-language="sh" results="verbatim" exports="both"}
ls *.jpg.pdf
```

``` example
IMG_3104.jpg.pdf
IMG_3105.jpg.pdf
IMG_3106.jpg.pdf
IMG_3107.jpg.pdf
```

Finally, join all pdfs into one. Turns out macOS has a handy python script already installed. We can use it as:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
/usr/bin/python "/System/Library/Automator/Combine PDF Pages.action/Contents/Resources/join.py" -o joined.pdf IMG_*pdf
```

ps. [pdfgrep](https://pdfgrep.org) is great for searching pdfs.

# \[2018-12-25 Tue\] Emailing pdfs to kindle from mu4e
---
id: emailing-pdfs-to-kindle-from-mu4e
---

Wanted to send a pdf to my kindle for some holiday reading. You can easily do this by emailing the pdf to your kindle-bound email address.

Now, I typically attach files when composing mu4e emails by using *mml-attach-file*, which attaches the file using *\<#part\>…\<#/part\>*. However, the Amazon service did not find the attached pdf, so no pdf was added to my Kindle.

Fortunately, I found a handy [Reddit thread, leding me to a working solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/97abs7/anyone_uses_mu4e_to_send_mobi_files_to_kindle). Wrapping the part using *\<#multipart type=mixed\>…\<#/multipart\>* did the job, using *mml-insert-multipart*, followed by *mml-attach-file*.

Resulting attachment should look something like:

``` example
<#multipart type=mixed>
<#part type="application/pdf" filename="/path/to/file.pdf" disposition=attachment>
<#/part>
<#/multipart>
```

I should add a convenience elisp function for this, but that's for another time…

# \[2018-12-08 Sat\] DWIM ivy quit
---
id: dwim-ivy-quit
---

"Do-what-I-mean" (DWIM) functions enable us to introduce new Emacs powers to existing workflows without incurring the typical cost of remembering multiple related functions or introducing yet another key binding. DWIM functions invoke other functions, based on current context.

I wanted a small tweak in Ivy's *\`minibuffer-keyboard-quit'* invocation, commonly invoked via *C-g* key binding:

1.  If we have text selected in minibuffer, deselect it.
2.  If we have any text in minibuffer, clear it.
3.  If no text in minibuffer, quit.

Added *\`ar/ivy-keyboard-quit-dwim'* for this purpose. Binding it to C-g in *ivy-minibuffer-map*:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(use-package ivy
  :ensure t
  :bind (:map ivy-minibuffer-map
              ("C-g" . ar/ivy-keyboard-quit-dwim))
  :config
  (defun ar/ivy-keyboard-quit-dwim ()
    "If region active, deactivate. If there's content, clear the minibuffer. Otherwise quit."
    (interactive)
    (cond ((and delete-selection-mode (region-active-p))
           (setq deactivate-mark t))
          ((> (length ivy-text) 0)
           (delete-minibuffer-contents))
          (t
           (minibuffer-keyboard-quit)))))
```

# \[2018-12-05 Wed\] Diffing directories content size
---
id: diffing-directories-content-size
---

Needed to diff two directories, but only interested in file size changes. diff, find, sort, and stat seem to do the job:

``` {.bash org-language="sh" results="verbatim" exports="both"}
diff <(find dir1 -type f -exec stat -f '%N %z' '{}' \; | sort) <(find dir2 -type f -exec stat -f '%N %z' '{}' \; | sort)
```

``` example
1,3c1,2
< dir1/one.txt 14
< dir1/subdir/file.txt 5
< dir1/three.txt 7
---
> dir2/one.txt 19
> dir2/two.txt 0
```

*Note: Using diff, find, sort, and stat on macOS.*

## Update 1

I've since learned about mtree (thanks [Roman](https://twitter.com/romanzolotarev/status/1070249301815771137)!). A nice utility to add to the toolbox.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
mtree -p emacs-25.1 -c -k size -d
```

``` example
#    user: me
# machine: my-machine
#    tree: /path/to/emacs-25.1
#    date: Wed Dec  5 22:21:07 2018
# .
/set type=dir
.               size=1152
# ./admin
admin           size=960
# ./admin/charsets
charsets        size=544
# ./admin/charsets/glibc
glibc           size=3392
# ./admin/charsets/glibc
..
# ./admin/charsets/mapfiles
mapfiles        size=640
# ./admin/charsets/mapfiles
..
```

## Update 2

I've added Emacs ediff to the mix:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(require 'f)

(defun ar/ediff-dir-content-size ()
    "Diff all subdirectories (sizes only) in two directories."
    (interactive)
    (let* ((dir1-path (read-directory-name "Dir 1: "))
           (dir2-path (read-directory-name "Dir 2: "))
           (buf1 (get-buffer-create (format "*Dir 1 (%s)*" (f-base dir1-path))))
           (buf2 (get-buffer-create (format "*Dir 2 (%s)*" (f-base dir2-path)))))
      (with-current-buffer buf1
        (erase-buffer))
      (with-current-buffer buf2
        (erase-buffer))
      (shell-command (format "cd %s; find . -type d | sort | du -h" dir1-path) buf1)
      (shell-command (format "cd %s; find . -type d | sort | du -h" dir2-path) buf2)
      (ediff-buffers buf1 buf2)))
```

One of the many highlights is the [nil-coalescing operator](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/BasicOperators.html#ID72). If you're a fan of the [C-like syntax in ternary operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_operation), you'd enjoy chaining with Swift's nil-coalescing operator:

``` swift

print("\(String(describing: move))")
```

Someone handed me an [Ocado](https://www.ocado.com) shopping voucher for 30% off. Sounded promising, even for a one-off.

On the upside, Ocado has plenty of items I cannot find at Asda. May be a good opportunity to get these items at a discount.

## Emacs org tables

Small tables are the perfect use-case for Emacs [org-mode tables](https://orgmode.org/manual/Tables.html). Been a while since I used one, so great timing for a little refresh.

Here's the org source for the table above (prior to exporting to HTML):

Been saving admin code snippets in my own [org source blocks](https://orgmode.org/manual/Working-with-source-code.html), some requiring root access.

id: multiline-swift-strings

[Paul Hudson's](https://twitter.com/twostraws) [tweet](https://twitter.com/twostraws) introduced me to Swift's multiline string indentation control using closing quotes. Neat!

Being an org-mode fan, I thought I'd give Swift multiline strings a try using Org [Babel's](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html) [ob-swift](https://github.com/zweifisch/ob-swift). I get to verify it and document at the same time. Win.

Swift org mode source blocks (ie. BEGIN_SRC/END_SRC) can be added as follows:

By pressing *C-c C-c* anywhere in the code block, the snippet is executed and its output captured in the *RESULT* block. Super handy for quickly trying out snippets and keeping as future reference.

As a bonus, the above blocks can be exported to HTML ([amongst other formats](https://orgmode.org/manual/Exporting.html)). With some [styling](https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/search?q=org-html-head-extra&unscoped_q=org-html-head-extra), it looks as follows:

``` {.swift exports="both"}
print("""
     Hello World
""")

print("""
     Hello World
     """)
```

``` example
     Hello World
Hello World
```

# \[2018-11-17 Sat\] Quickly swapping elfeed filters
---
id: quickly-swapping-elfeed-filters
---

I seem to be more efficient in getting through rss feeds by individually browsing through related content. That is, I can get through all Emacs entries a lot faster if I look at Emacs content exclusively, instead of mixing with say BBC news. [Elfeed](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed) filters are great for filtering related content.

I wanted a way to easily switch through my typical categories of related content by quickly changing elfeed filters using a completion framework.

Emacs's [completing-read](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Minibuffer-Completion.html) plays nicely with your favorite completing framework (mine is [ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper)). With a couple of functions, we can get Emacs to ask us for the filtering category using human-readable options and quickly presenting related content. Binding the new functionality to \<tab\> is working well for me.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(use-package elfeed :ensure t
  :commands elfeed
  :bind (:map elfeed-search-mode-map
              ("<tab>" . ar/elfeed-completing-filter))
  :config
  (defun ar/elfeed-filter-results-count (search-filter)
    "Count results for SEARCH-FILTER."
    (let* ((filter (elfeed-search-parse-filter search-filter))
           (head (list nil))
           (tail head)
           (count 0))
      (let ((lexical-binding t)
            (func (byte-compile (elfeed-search-compile-filter filter))))
        (with-elfeed-db-visit (entry feed)
          (when (funcall func entry feed count)
            (setf (cdr tail) (list entry)
                  tail (cdr tail)
                  count (1+ count)))))
      count))

  (defun ar/elfeed-completing-filter ()
    "Completing filter."
    (interactive)
    (let ((categories (-filter
                       (lambda (item)
                         (> (ar/elfeed-filter-results-count (cdr item))
                            0))
                       '(("All" . "@6-months-ago +unread")
                         ("BBC" . "@6-months-ago +unread +bbc")
                         ("Dev" . "@6-months-ago +unread +dev")
                         ("Emacs" . "@6-months-ago +unread +emacs")
                         ("Health" . "@6-months-ago +unread +health")
                         ("Hacker News" . "@6-months-ago +unread +hackernews")
                         ("iOS" . "@6-months-ago +unread +ios")
                         ("Money" . "@6-months-ago +unread +money")))))
      (if (> (length categories) 0)
          (progn
            (ar/elfeed-view-filtered (cdr (assoc (completing-read "Categories: " categories)
                                                 categories)))
            (goto-char (window-start)))
        (message "All caught up \\o/")))))
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/quickly-swapping-elfeed-filters/completing-elfeed.gif)

We don't actually need two functions, but *ar/elfeed-filter-results-count* enables us to list only those feeds that actually have new content. The list will shrink as we get through our content. When no content is left, we get a little celebratory message.

id: faster-elfeed-browsing-with-paging

Following up from [faster junk mail deletion with mu4e](http://xenodium.com/#faster-junk-mail-deletion-with-mu4e), elfeed is another candidate for enabling actions on pages. In this case, marking rss entries as read, page by Page.

If on [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package), the function can defined and bound to the "v" key using:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(use-package elfeed
  :ensure t
  :bind (:map elfeed-search-mode-map
              ("v" . ar/elfeed-mark-visible-as-read))
  :config
  (defun ar/elfeed-mark-visible-as-read ()
    (interactive)
    (require 'window-end-visible)
    (set-mark (window-start))
    (goto-char (window-end-visible))
    (activate-mark)
    (elfeed-search-untag-all-unread)
    (elfeed-search-update--force)
    (deactivate-mark)
    (goto-char (window-start))))
```

# \[2018-11-10 Sat\] Faster junk mail deletion with mu4e
---
id: faster-junk-mail-deletion-with-mu4e
---

It's been roughly 5 months since [my mu4e email migration](http://xenodium.com/#trying-out-mu4e-and-offlineimap). Happy with my choice. [Mu4e](http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html) is awesome.

I now have 4 email accounts managed by mu4e, and unfortunately receiving lots of junk mail.

I regularly peek at junk folders for false positives and delete junk email permanently. I've been wanting a quick way to glance at junk mail and easily delete page by page.

Deleting emails page by page is not supported in mu4e by default. *Fortunately, this is Emacs and we can change that™.*

There's a handy package by Roland Walker called [window-end-visible](http://github.com/rolandwalker/window-end-visible). We can use it to select mu4e emails by page and subsequently glue it all together to enable deleting emails by page.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(require 'mu4e)
(require 'window-end-visible)

(defun ar/mu4e-delete-page ()
  (interactive)
  (set-mark (window-start))
  (goto-char (window-end-visible))
  (activate-mark)
  (mu4e-headers-mark-for-trash)
  (mu4e-mark-execute-all t)
  (deactivate-mark)
  (goto-char (window-start)))
```

I'm a [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package) fan, so I use it to bind the "v" key to delete *visible emails (by page*).

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(use-package mu4e
  :bind (:map mu4e-headers-mode-map
         ("v" . ar/mu4e-delete-page))
```

# \[2018-11-06 Tue\] Working with vultr's ipv6-only instances
---
id: working-with-vultrs-ipv6-only-instances
---

Having recently read [Your Money or Your Life](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Transforming-Relationship-Achieving-Financial-Independence/dp/0143115766/), I've been cutting down on personal expenses wherever possible. Specially recurring expenses which include monthly charges from VPS hosting. Let's reduce those charges…

My VPS needs are fairly small (mostly hobby and tinkering). [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7579034)† has a plan for \$2.50/month (not seen anything cheaper). The caveat for the price, you get ipv6 access only (ie. 0000:1111:2222:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888).

So far so good, but my ISP doesn't yet support ipv6:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
$ ping6 0000:1111:2222:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888
$ ping6: UDP connect: No route to host
```

Fortunately, we can still work with ipv6 by using a tunnel (TIL about [Hurricane Electric's tunnel broker](https://tunnelbroker.net)). After signing up and creating a tunnel, they conveniently show you "Example Configurations" from the "Tunnel Details" menu. In my case, macOS:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
ifconfig gif0 create
ifconfig gif0 tunnel <ipv4 client broker IP or DCHP internal IP> <ipv4 server IP>
ifconfig gif0 inet6 <ipv6 client broker IP> <ipv6 server IP> prefixlen 128
route -n add -inet6 default <ipv6 server IP>
```

Note: If behind router, use the DHCP internal IP.

After configuring with ifconfig, all is good. Yay!

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
$ ping6 0000:1111:2222:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888
PING6(56=40+8+8 bytes) 2001:111:22:aaa::2 --> 0000:1111:2222:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888
16 bytes from 0000:1111:2222:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888, icmp_seq=0 hlim=52 time=270.019 ms
16 bytes from 0000:1111:2222:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888, icmp_seq=1 hlim=52 time=290.834 ms
16 bytes from 0000:1111:2222:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888, icmp_seq=2 hlim=52 time=311.960 ms
16 bytes from 0000:1111:2222:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888, icmp_seq=3 hlim=52 time=330.902 ms
```

I'm an ipv6 noob. I mostly need ssh access. My typical usages need small tweaks.

For ssh:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
ssh -6 username@0000:1111:2222:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888
```

For scp:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
scp -6 file.txt username@\[0000:1111:2222:3333:4444:5555:6666:7777:8888\]:/remote/dir/
```

# \[2018-10-17 Wed\] imenu on Emacs eshell
---
id: imenu-on-emacs-eshell
---

[imenu](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Imenu.html) navigation is one of those Emacs gems I didn't discover until much later on. It does what you'd expect in all types of modes. In rare instances, I've found specific modes missing imenu support. Fortunately, this is Emacs and you can fix that.

[Eshell](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html) has a handy feature to jump back and forth over previous prompts using *M-x eshell-previous-prompt (C-c C-p)* and *M-x eshell-next-prompt (C-c C-n)*. Upon learning about these two functions, my immediate reaction was to try imenu. Surprisingly, it didn't "just work", but a tiny bit of elisp brought balance back to the Emacs universe.

In an eshell mode hook function, one can set the [imenu-generic-expression](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Imenu.html#index-imenu_002dgeneric_002dexpression-2058) to help it find your favorite prompt:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(setq-local imenu-generic-expression
                  '(("Prompt" " $ \\(.*\\)" 1)))
```

Ah it's the little things…

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/imenu-on-emacs-eshell/eshell-imenu.gif)

ps. If wondering why my imenu experience looks a little different, that's because I'm using Abo Abo's wonderful [counsel](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper) and *M-x counsel-semantic-or-imenu*.

# \[2018-08-12 Sun\] M-r history search in git-commit-mode
---
id: m-r-history-search-in-git-commit-mode
---

I've grown accustomed to M-r bindings to search Emacs history. Been wanting similar functionality to search commit message history. Turns out *log-edit-comment-ring* has some of my local commit message history. Feeding it to *completing-read* gives me an easily searchable history when using a completing framework like ivy or helm:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(defun ar/git-commit-search-message-history ()
  "Search and insert commit message from history."
  (interactive)
  (insert (completing-read "History: "
                           ;; Remove unnecessary newlines from beginning and end.
                           (mapcar (lambda (text)
                                     (string-trim text))
                                   (ring-elements log-edit-comment-ring)))))
```

Now we bind it to *M-r* and we're good to go:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(bind-key "M-r" #'ar/git-commit-search-message-history git-commit-mode-map)
```

May also want to persist *log-edit-comment-ring* across Emacs sessions by adding *log-edit-comment-ring* to savehist variables. Also ensure *savehist-mode* is enabled:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(add-to-list 'savehist-additional-variables log-edit-comment-ring)
(savehist-mode +1)
```

id: marking-20k-emails-as-read
---

[Mbsync](http://isync.sourceforge.net/) and [mu4e](https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html) are great for syncing and handling IMAP email. I've now migrated 4 email addresses, including an old Yahoo account.

I wanted to mark all my Yahoo unread emails as read. Yahoo's webmail enables marking 500 emails at a time, making the process a little tedious.

[Mu-discuss](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mu-discuss) has a handy [thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mu-discuss/zaA394sH1Ow/QSVPXS22BQAJ), highlighting that moving/renaming synced messages (in your local file system) would do the job. This worked well for me.

Let's do just that…

**WARNING:** Copy a small sample of your mails to a separate directory and run some trials until you feel comfortable.

Find your mail directory.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
cd path/to/mail
```

Peek at the messages you'd like to mark unread:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
ls -1 new/
```

Rename message files by appending "S" to their filename and moving from new/ to cur/ directory.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
for FILE in new/*; do mv "${FILE}" cur/$(basename "${FILE}")S; done;
```

We can verify the move.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
ls -1 cur/
```

Let's sync the local changes.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
mbsync -Va
```

…and we're done ;)

# \[2018-07-11 Wed\] fitbit API, org babel, and gnuplot
---
id: fitbit-api-org-babel-and-gnuplot
---

Retook running recently. Took the dust off my aria scale and used the opportunity to check out fitbit's API.

First register your app at [dev.fitbit.com/apps/new](https://dev.fitbit.com/apps/new) and get a client_id=AABBCC.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/fitbit-api-org-babel-and-gnuplot/fitbitapp.png)

You'll also need your USER_ID, from your Fitbitx user profile.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/fitbit-api-org-babel-and-gnuplot/fitbituser.png)

We'll also need a token. I used the [implicit grant flow](https://dev.fitbit.com/build/reference/web-api/oauth2/) URL in my browser and extracted access_token=TOKEN.

Now let's wire up two org source blocks to fetch the data and subsequently plot using gnuplot.

It's pretty neat. You can take the output from one source block and use it as input to another.

We use curl to fetch data from fitbit's API and pipe through [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and sed to massage the output format into two columns.

**Note:** Before using gnuplot in org babel, you'll need to install the gnuplot package and add to babel languages.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(use-package gnuplot :ensure t)

(use-package ob
  :config
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((gnuplot . t))))
```

``` {#weight-data .bash org-language="sh" results="table"}
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" https://api.fitbit.com/1/user/USER_ID/body/weight/date/2018-06-09/2018-07-11.json | jq '.[][] | "\(.dateTime) \(.value)"' | sed 's/"//g'
```

  2018-07-11   63.95

Now feed the two column data to gnuplot.

``` {.gnuplot var="data=weight-data" exports="code" file="images/fitbit-api-org-babel-and-gnuplot/weight.png"}
reset
set title "My recent weight"
set xdata time
set timefmt '%Y-%m-%d'
set format x "%d/%m/%y"
set term png
set xrange ['2018-06-09':'2018-07-11']
plot data u 1:2 with linespoints title 'Weight in Kg'
```

Fetching data and plotting through org babel and gnuplot is pretty sweet. I've barely scratched the surface. There's more at [Org-babel-gnuplot](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-gnuplot.html) and [Plotting tables in Org-Mode using org-plot](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-plot.html). Either way, this is another Emacs super power to keep in the toolbox.

If you're a tinkerer, you'd enjoy the powerful [Hammerspoon](http://hammerspoon.org/). Like elisp gluing all things Emacs, Hammerspoon uses Lua to glue all things macOS. You can build your own narrowing utilities using [chooser](http://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/hs.chooser.html) and a little Lua.

    local chooser = hs.chooser.new(function(choice)
          hs.alert.show(choice['text'])
    end)

    chooser:choices({
          {
             ["text"] = "Alfred\n",
             ["subText"] = "macOS only\n",
          },
          {
             ["text"] = "Quicksilver\n",
             ["subText"] = "macOS only\n",
          },
          {
             ["text"] = "Hammerspoon\n",
             ["subText"] = "macOS only\n",
          },
          {
             ["text"] = "Emacs\n",
             ["subText"] = "is everywhere :)\n",
          },
    })
    chooser:show()

Howard Abrams's post on [Capturing Content for Emacs](http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/capturing-content.html) inspired me to look at gluing Emacs and macOS to launch my own cross-platform narrowing utilities.

I've also taken this opportunity to look at Oleh Krehel's wonderful completion package: [Ivy](https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper). We can use it to build a macOS narrowing utility.

Ivy is remarkably easy to use. Turns out, [ivy-read](http://oremacs.com/swiper/#api) is all you need. A simple Emacs completion can be accomplished with little elisp.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(ivy-read "Hello ivy: "
          '("One "
            "Two "
            "Three "
            "Four "))
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-utilities-for-your-os/simple_ivy.png)

Pretty nifty. Let's make this completion more accessible from the rest of the OS. To do so, we create a separate Emacs frame and make it pretty. We also want it to interact with the OS. We'll use *ivy-read*'s *:action* to invoke a tiny bit of AppleScript.

Oh and we'll also use some funny quotes to tease ourselves about our beloved editor.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create "*modal-ivy*")
  (let ((frame (make-frame '((auto-raise . t)

So where's all this going? I wrote a utility to extract all links from [this page's org file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenodium/xenodium.github.io/master/index.org) and make them easily searchable from anywhere on macOS by invoking **⌥-W**.

The keys are bound using Lua, Hammerspoon, and emacsclient. This works well on macOS, but there are alternatives for other operating systems.

    hs.execute("emacsclient -ne \""..elisp.."\" -s /tmp/emacs*/server")

Here's the resulting utility in action:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-utilities-for-your-os/ivy_links.gif)

These integrations look promising. They enable me to bring cross-platform Emacs utilities into areas I hadn't considered.

# \[2018-06-17 Sun\] Trying out mu4e with mbsync
---
id: trying-out-mu4e-with-mbsync
---

The email fun in Emacs continues. After a few weeks since I [started using mu4e and offlineimap](#trying-out-mu4e-and-offlineimap), I'm sold. Both are awesome. [Mbsync](http://isync.sourceforge.net/mbsync.html) is an [offlineimap](http://www.offlineimap.org/) alternative. Despite resyncing all my mail, the transition was fairly smooth. Here's how…

## Install isync (for mbsync)

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install isync
```

## Configure mbsync

Mbsync uses `~/.mbsyncrc` for configuration. Migrating [\~/.offlineimaprc](#trying-out-mu4e-and-offlineimap) to `~/.mbsyncrc` looks like:

``` conf
IMAPAccount Personal
Host some.imap.host.com
User your_user_name
PassCmd "gpg --quiet --batch -d ~/.offlineimap_accountname.gpg"
Port 993
SSLType IMAPS
AuthMechs Login
CertificateFile  ~/.offlineimapcerts.pem
# My IMAP provider doesn't handle concurrent IMAP commands.
PipelineDepth 1

IMAPStore Personal-remote
Account Personal

MaildirStore Personal-local
Path ~/IMAP/Personal/
Inbox ~/IMAP/Personal/INBOX

Channel Personal
Master :Personal-remote:
Slave :Personal-local:
Patterns *
Create Slave
Sync All
Expunge Both
SyncState *
```

## No concurrent IMAP commands supported

My IMAP provider doesn't handle concurrent IMAP commands. [mbsync and Office 365](https://kdecherf.com/blog/2017/05/01/mbsync-and-office-365/) had the answer:

``` conf
PipelineDepth 1
```

## Initial sync

Run initial from the command line sync:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
mbsync -Va
```

While syncing my largest inbox, it sometimes received an unexpected EOF error:

    IMAP error: unexpected EOF from some.imap.host.com (1.2.3.4:993)

First few times, I restarted the syncing manually, but then used a loop to automatically restart it.

Bash loops:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
while true; do mbsync -V Personal; sleep 5; done
```

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
for i in {1..5}; do mbsync -V Personal; sleep 5; done
```

Eshell loop:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
for i in (number-sequence 1 10) {mbsync -V Personal; sleep 5}
```

## Create mu index

Reindex using mu, but first remove existing index for offlineimap messages:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
rm -rf ~/.mu
```

Ok, do index now:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
mu index --maildir=~/IMAP
```

## Mu4e tweaks

The *get mail* command should now point to mbsync.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(csetq mu4e-get-mail-command "mbsync -Va")
```

I had issues with duplicate IDs after moving and deleting messages from mu4e. [Migrating from offlineimap to mbsync for mu4e](http://pragmaticemacs.com/emacs/migrating-from-offlineimap-to-mbsync-for-mu4e/) had the answer:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(csetq mu4e-change-filenames-when-moving t)
```

# \[2018-06-13 Wed\] GNU find on macOS
---
id: gnu-find-on-macos

At times, you may need GNU versions of command line utilities on macOS. For example, GNU find.

As usual, Homebrew saves the day. Install with:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install findutils
```

Unless you install with –with-default-names (I don't), GNU utilities will be prefixed with a "g".

``` {.bash org-language="sh" results="verbatim"}
gfind --version
```

If you need more, there are others:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install binutils
brew install diffutils
brew install ed
brew install findutils
brew install gawk
brew install gnu-indent
brew install gnu-sed
brew install gnu-tar
brew install gnu-which
brew install gnutls
brew install grep
brew install gzip
brew install screen
brew install watch
brew install wdiff --with-gettext
brew install wget

Managing Email from Emacs. Surely that's crazy-talk, but hey… let's give it a try.

## Install offlineimap

Need to sync via imap. Use offlineimap. I'm on macOS, so homebrew is king for installing:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install offlineimap
```

Before can configure offlineimap, we'll need to handle a few things first.

## Get a cert fingerprint

Use openssl for getting a certificate fingerprint. From offlineimap's [FAQ:](http://www.offlineimap.org/doc/FAQ.html#view-the-fingerprint)

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
SSL_CERT_DIR="" openssl s_client -connect imap.migadu.com:993 < /dev/null 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -fingerprint -noout -text -in /dev/stdin
```

Should give you something like:

> SHA1 Fingerprint=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:DD:FF:AA:00:AA:2A:AA:AA:AA:A8:20:80:AA:A2:AA

## Encrypt password

Offlineimap can read passwords in plain text in its .offlineimaprc config file, but that's yuckie. Let's encrypt the password and use gnupg for that. Install it:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install gnupg
```

If you haven't already, generate a key

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
gpg --full-gen-key
```

Generate an offlineimap account password file.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
echo "YourPassword" | gpg --encrypt --recipient "Your Name" -o ~/.offlineimap_accountname.gpg
```

## Python password wrapper

Based on Fabian's [Encrypt OfflineIMAP and msmtp password with GnuPG](https://f-koehler.github.io/posts/2015-03-17-offlineimap-msmtp-gnupg.html), I created \~/.read_password.py with:

``` python
import os
import subprocess

def read_password(path):
  return subprocess.check_output(["gpg\n", "--quiet\n", "--batch\n", "-d\n", os.path.expanduser(path)]).strip()
```

ps. Alternatively, see [The homely Mutt](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/the-homely-mutt/#retrieving-passwords)'s section to store password in macOS's keychain.

## Configure offlineimap

Offlineimap uses \~/.offlineimaprc for configuration. We now have all we need to put the configuration together:

``` conf
[general]
accounts = Personal

# Load this python file.
pythonfile = ~/.read_password.py

[Account Personal]
localrepository = Personal-Local

remoterepository = Personal-Remote

# After syncing, let mu index it.
postsynchook = mu index --maildir ~/stuff/active/Mail

# Sync imap every 5 minutes.
autorefresh = 5

# Alternate between 10 quick syncs and full syncs.
quick = 10

[Repository Personal-Local]
type = Maildir
localfolders = ~/stuff/active/Mail/Personal

[Repository Personal-Remote]
type = IMAP
remotehost = some.imap.host.com
remoteuser = your_user_name

# Use function defined in .read_password.py to read the password.
remotepasseval = read_password("~/.offlineimap_personal_account_password.gpg")

# Use the SHA1 fingerprint retrieved with openssl.
cert_fingerprint = aabbccddeeddffaa00aa2aaaaaaaa82080aaa2aa
```

### Cert file

You can use macOS's certificates from Keychain Access -\> System Roots -\> Certificates, select all, and ⌘-⇧-e (for export items). Save to \~/certs.pem and use offlineimap configutation:

> sslcacertfile = /path/to/certs.pem

Another option is executing lib/mk-ca-bundle.pl from curl's tarball to generate ca-bundle.crt, using certdata.txt from Mozilla's source tree.

## Install mu4e

Manually modified mu4e recipe to pick up my Emacs binary. TIL about homebrew's edit command:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew edit mu
```

Changed the one line:

> -   ENV\["EMACS"\] = "no" if build.without? "emacs"
> -   ENV\["EMACS"\] = "/Users/alvaro/homebrew/Cellar/emacs-plus/26.1-rc1_2/bin/emacs"

Finally installed mu4e:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install mu
```

## Configure mu4e

Lastly, configure mu4e:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(add-to-list 'load-path
             (expand-file-name "~/homebrew/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu/mu4e"))

Happy with [Emacs Plus](https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus) builds on Mac. You get some eye-candy bonuses like transparent titlebars.

To install:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
brew install emacs-plus --without-spacemacs-icon
```

Config:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(when (memq window-system '(mac ns))
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-appearance . dark)) ; nil for dark text
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-transparent-titlebar . t)))

# \[2018-04-30 Mon\] Pre-commit hooks to save you from yourself
---
id: pre-commit-hooks-to-save-you-from-yourself
---

Wanted to try out some code, but needed to ensure never checked in. Git pre-commit hooks are handy in this space. Add the following script to search for either \@COMMITFAIL or \@NOCOMMIT in the staged files. If found, attempts to commit will fail.

Based on <https://gist.github.com/rex/223b4be50285f6b8b3e06dea50d15887>:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
#!/bin/bash

set -o nounset
set -o errexit

echo "Arguments:"
echo "$@"
echo "---"

readonly FILES_PATTERN='(\..+)?$'
readonly FORBIDDEN='(@?NOCOMMIT|@?COMMITFAIL)'

if ( git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E "$FILES_PATTERN" | xargs grep -E --with-filename -n "$FORBIDDEN" ); then
  echo "ERROR: @COMMITFAIL or @NOCOMMIT found. Exiting to save you from yourself."
  exit 1
fi
```

Save to a file and create a symbolic link to your .git/hooks directory:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
ln -s ../../git/commit-fail-pre-hook.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

# \[2017-12-13 Wed\] Homebrew install from cache
---
id: homebrew-install-from-cache

# \[2017-11-16 Thu\] org-babel Objective-C support
---
id: org-babel-objective-c-support
---

Wanted to quickly execute an Objective-C snippet. org-babel didn't support it out of the box, but adding it was straightforward (looked at ob-C.el and ob-java.el):

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(require 'ob)

(defcustom org-babel-objc-compile-command "clang -x objective-c -framework Foundation"
  "For example: \"clang -x objective-c -framework Foundation\"."
  :group 'org-babel
  :version "24.3"
  :type 'string)

(defun org-babel-execute:objc (body params)
  "Compile Objective-C BODY with org PARAMS and execute binary."
  (let* ((src-file (org-babel-temp-file "org-babel-objc-block-" ".m"))
         (cmpflag (or (cdr (assq :cmpflag params)) ""))
         (full-body (org-babel-expand-body:generic body params))
         (bin-file
          (org-babel-process-file-name
           (org-babel-temp-file "org-babel-objc-block" org-babel-exeext))))
    (with-temp-file src-file (insert full-body))
    (org-babel-eval
     (concat org-babel-objc-compile-command " " cmpflag " " src-file " " "-o" " " bin-file) "")

    ;; Using 2>&1 since org babel does not include stderr in output from NSLog.
    (let ((results (org-babel-eval (concat (org-babel-process-file-name bin-file) " 2>&1")  "")))
      (org-babel-reassemble-table
       (org-babel-result-cond (cdr (assq :result-params params))
         (org-babel-read results)
         (let ((tmp-file (org-babel-temp-file "c-")))
           (with-temp-file tmp-file (insert results))
           (org-babel-import-elisp-from-file tmp-file)))
       (org-babel-pick-name
        (cdr (assq :colname-names params)) (cdr (assq :colnames params)))
       (org-babel-pick-name
        (cdr (assq :rowname-names params)) (cdr (assq :rownames params)))))))

(provide 'ob-objc)
```

Add *objc* to *org-babel-load-languages*, and you can subsequently compile and run Objective-C blocks like:

``` {.objc results="verbatim"}
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

int main() {
  NSLog(@"Hello World");
  return 0;
}
```

id: eshell-pcomplete-company-completion

Howard Abrams's [Introduction to eshell video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhYNu6i_uY4) prompted me to poke at eshell some more. This time, I got eshell context aware completion by glueing the excellent [company](https://company-mode.github.io) and [pcomplete](https://masteringemacs.org/article/pcomplete-context-sensitive-completion-emacs) packages.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/eshell-pcomplete-company-completion/company-pcomplete.png)

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'company)
(require 'dash)
(require 'pcomplete)
(require 's)

(defun company-pcomplete--overlap-tail (a b)
  "When A is \"SomeDev\" and B is \"Developer\", return \"eloper\"."
  (let ((prefix a)
        (remaining nil))
    (while (and (not remaining) (> (length prefix) 0))
      (when (s-starts-with? prefix b)
        (setq remaining (substring b (length prefix))))
      (setq prefix (substring prefix 1)))
    remaining))

(defun company-pcomplete--candidates (prefix)
  "Get candidates for PREFIX company completion using `pcomplete'."
  ;; When prefix is: "~/Down" and completion is "Downloads", need
  ;; to find common string and join into "~/Downloads/".
  (-map (lambda (item)
          (if (s-starts-with? prefix item)
              item
            (concat prefix (company-pcomplete--overlap-tail prefix item))))
        (all-completions prefix (pcomplete-completions))))

  "Complete using pcomplete. See `company''s COMMAND ARG and IGNORED for details."

```

Don't forget to add *company-pcomplete* to *company-backends,* and if you want an explicit binding, use something like:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}

[Projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile) and [company](https://company-mode.github.io) are just amazing Emacs packages. Projectile gives random access to files, while company completes well… anything. For shells, Emacs has a handful of options.

Bought a pair of QuietComfort 35. Audio quality on MacOS was lagging compared to iOS. Googling led to different posts suggesting the use of Bluetooth Explorer to force aptX usage. Did the trick for me.

**Bluetooth Explorer** can be downloaded from <https://developer.apple.com/download/more>. Search for Hardware IO tools:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/forcing-aptx-on-macos-bluetooth-audio/download-bluetooth-explorer.png)

Open **Hardware_IO_Tools_for_Xcode_7.3.dmg** and launch **Bluetooth Explorer**:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/forcing-aptx-on-macos-bluetooth-audio/tools-image.png)

Select **Audio Options**:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/forcing-aptx-on-macos-bluetooth-audio/audio-options.png)

Check **Force use of aptX**:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/forcing-aptx-on-macos-bluetooth-audio/force-aptx.png)

Don't forget to disconnect and reconnect your Bluetooth device.

# \[2017-04-23 Sun\] GnuPG and macOS
---
id: gnupg-and-macos

Had problems installing and using GnuPG on macOS, primarily for Emacs use:

``` example
gpg: problem with the agent: Inappropriate ioctl for device
gpg: error creating passphrase: Operation cancelled
gpg: symmetric encryption of '[stdin]' failed: Operation cancelled
```

Basic installation required:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install gnupg
```

But worked around the error above by using pinentry-mac (UI), instead of Emacs prompts.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install pinentry-mac
```

Edited \~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf with:

``` example
pinentry-program path/to/homebrew/bin/pinentry-mac
```

May need to kill gpg-agent to reload config.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
gpgconf --kill gpg-agent
```

# \[2017-03-13 Mon\] Installing gnuplot on macOS
---
id: installing-gnuplot-on-macos
---

UPDATE(2019-05-19 Sun): Plan A and B use options no longer available since the recent changes to [remove all options from Homebrew/homebrew-core formulae](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/31510). See Plan C.

## ~~Plan A~~

### ~~Install gnuplot Qt~~

~~If you have the resources, you can try the Qt flavor. You need at least 15GB to download and a long build. Ran out of space on my Macbook Air. Aborted.~~

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install gnuplot --with-qt
```

## ~~Plan B~~

### ~~Install xquartz~~

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz
```

### ~~Install gnuplot x11~~

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install gnuplot --with-x11
```

## Install feedgnuplot

Feedgnuplot is handy for plotting data streams realtime.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install feedgnuplot
```

## Plan C

### Install with no options

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install gnuplot
```

So far so good, but default gnuplot formula uses Qt and the Cocoa plugin could not be loaded:

> qt.qpa.plugin: Could not find the Qt platform plugin "cocoa" in ""

### Debugging

1.  QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS

    Turns out you can get plugin logs using the QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS environment variable:

    ``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
    export QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS=1
    ```

    > QFactoryLoader::QFactoryLoader() checking directory path "/Users/myuser/homebrew/Cellar/gnuplot/5.2.6_1/libexec/gnuplot/5.2/platforms" …

    This led me to find out about the *gnuplot/5.2/gnuplot_qt* binary.

2.  qt_prfxpath

    Getting the Qt prefix can be done by inspecting QtCore's strings:

    ``` {.bash org-language="sh" results="output" exports="both"}
    strings /Users/myuser/homebrew/Cellar/qt/5.12.3/Frameworks/QtCore.framework/QtCore | grep qt_prfxpath
    ```

    ``` example
    qt_prfxpath=/usr/local/Cellar/qt/5.12.3
    ```

    Ok so qt_prfxpath is pointing to **usr/local/Cellar/qt*, while my installation's is at //Users/myuser/homebrew/Cellar/qt*. This is problematic and indeed my fault for installing homebrew in **Users/myuser/homebrew* instead of the recommended //usr/local*.

    Symlinking did the job:

    ``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/Cellar
    sudo ln -s ~/homebrew/Cellar/qt /usr/local/Cellar/qt
    ```

    ``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
    /Users/myuser/homebrew/Cellar/gnuplot/5.2.6_1/libexec/gnuplot/5.2/gnuplot_qt
    ```

    Success.

id: handy-pdf-utilities
---

Straight out of [How (and why) I made a zine](http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/08/29/how-i-made-a-zine), some handy utilities for generating pdfs…

## Convert pngs to pdfs

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
# start with a bunch of PNG images of your zine pages
# convert them all to PDF
for i in *.png
   do
      # imagemagick is the best thing in the world
      convert $i $i.pdf
   done
```

## Combine pdfs

Combine pdfs using pdftk:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
pdftk *.pdf cat output zine.pdf
```

Combine pdfs using poppler:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
pdf unite PDF1.pdf PDF2.pdf PDF3.pdf
```

## Reorder pdf pages

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
# pdfmod is a GUI that lets you reorder pages
pdfmod zine.pdf
```

## Add margins to pdf

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
# pdfcrop lets you add margins to the pdf. this is good because otherwise the
# printer will cut off stuff at the edges
pdfcrop --margin '29 29 29 29' zine.pdf zine-intermediate.pdf
```

## Turn pdf into booklet

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
# pdfjam is this wizard tool that lets you take a normal ordered pdf and turn
# it into something you can print as a booklet on a regular printer.
# no more worrying about photocopying machines
pdfjam --booklet true --landscape --suffix book --letterpaper --signature 12 --booklet true --landscape zine-intermediate.pdf -o zine-booklet.pdf
```

# \[2016-09-15 Thu\] Fuzzy search Emacs compile history
---
id: fuzzy-search-emacs-compile-history
---

I wrote about [searching bash history with Emacs Helm](#search-bash-history-with-emacs-helm) some time ago. Since then, I've learned about *completing-read* to generically handle simple Emacs completions (very handy for supporting Helm, Ivy, and Ido completions).

Here's a simple way to combine *completing-read* and the *compile* command to enable fuzzy searching your compile history:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/fuzzy-search-emacs-compile-history/fuzzy_compile.gif)

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(defun ar/compile-completing ()
  "Compile with completing options."
  (interactive)
  (let ((compile-command (completing-read "Compile command: " compile-history)))
    (compile compile-command)
    (add-to-list 'compile-history compile-command)))
```

# \[2016-09-05 Mon\] Jumping on the Emacs 25 bandwagon
---
id: jumping-on-emacs-25-bandwagon
---

Can't miss out on all the new fun. Emacs 25 RC2 is out and lots of people already using it. Since I'm mostly on MacOS these days, installing via homebrew with –devel, gets you RC2:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install emacs --devel --with-cocoa --with-gnutls --with-librsvg --with-imagemagick
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/jumping-on-emacs-25-bandwagon/emacs25.png)

The only hiccup so far's been org mode failing to export, which was fixed by re-installing it (follow [this thread](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2015-08/msg00320.html)).

# \[2016-06-17 Fri\] Emacs and emotional vocab
---
id: emacs-and-emotional-vocab
---

Having read [Are You in Despair? That’s Good](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/05/opinion/sunday/are-you-in-despair-thats-good.html), I was encouraged to expand my emotional vocabulary. As a [zone.el](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/play/zone.el) fan (checkout [nyan](https://github.com/wasamasa/zone-nyan), [sl](https://github.com/kawabata/zone-sl), and [rainbow](https://github.com/kawabata/zone-rainbow)), I looked into writing a zone [program](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/play/zone.el#L52). When *zone-when-idle* is set, zone acts as a screensaver of sorts. We can use this to display random emotional vocab whenever Emacs is idle for a period of time. Let's get to it…

Zone keeps a list of programs to choose from when kicked off. Below is a basic *zone-hello* program, along with an interactive command for previewing. Not much to these. The tiny program prepares the screen for zoning and inserts text while no input is pending.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(defun zone-hello ()
  (delete-other-windows)
  (setq mode-line-format nil)
  (zone-fill-out-screen (window-width) (window-height))
  (delete-region (point-min) (point-max))
  (goto-char (point-min))
  (while (not (input-pending-p))
    (insert "hello zone\n")
    (zone-park/sit-for (point-min) 0.2)))

(defun zone-hello-preview ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((zone-programs [zone-hello]))
    (zone)))
```

Here's what *zone-hello* looks like:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-and-emotional-vocab/minimal-zone.gif)

Back to improving our emotional vocabulary, we'll need a dictionary for our goal. A quick search yields a potential list of [words](http://www.psychpage.com/learning/library/assess/feelings.html). We can use [WordNet](http://wordnet.princeton.edu/) to define them while offline. These two sources will do for now. We tie it all together in [zone-words.el](https://github.com/xenodium/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/ar/zone-words.el) and the resulting zone program looks as follow:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-and-emotional-vocab/emotions.gif)

UPDATE: Just came across [Animations With Emacs](http://blog.josephwilk.net/art/emacs-animation.html). A post with awesome zone examples.

# \[2016-05-10 Tue\] Emacs: Find number of days between dates
---
id: emacs-find-number-of-days-between-dates
---

Needed to find the number of days between two dates. Emacs calendar must know this…

-   Fire up the manual (M-x info-emacs-manual or C-h r).
-   Info-goto-node (or g).
-   Type "counting days" and voilá:

> To determine the number of days in a range, set the mark on one date using \`C-\<SPC\>', move point to another date, and type \`M-=' (\`calendar-count-days-region'). The numbers of days shown is [inclusive]{.underline}; that is, it includes the days specified by mark and point.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/emacs-find-number-of-days-between-dates/emacs-days-between-dates.gif)

*Note: you can use the mouse to jump to another date, or "g d" (calendar-goto-date).*

id: defined-elisp-variables-matching-regexp

You can use "M-x *apropos-variable*" to get documentation for variables matching a pattern. For more flexibility, some elisp can help with getting a list of all variables matching a regexp:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp" exports="both"}
(defun ar/variables-matching-pattern (pattern)
  "Get a list of all variables matching PATTERN."
  (let ((matched-variables '()))
    (mapatoms
     (lambda (symbol)
       ;; Symbol is variable?
       (when (and (boundp symbol)
                  (string-match pattern (symbol-name symbol)))
         (add-to-list 'matched-variables symbol))))
    matched-variables))

(let ((variables ""))
  (mapc (lambda (variable-symbol)
          (setq variables
                (concat variables
                        (format "%s => %s\n"
                                (symbol-name variable-symbol)
                                (symbol-value variable-symbol)))))
        (ar/variables-matching-pattern "^tern-.*"))
  variables)
```

``` example

I previously noted [how to undo your last git commit (ie. soft reset)](#doh-undo-last-git-commit). Using Magit:

1.  M-x *magit-log-current*.
2.  Move point to prior revision.
3.  M-x *magit-reset-soft* (defaults to revision at point).

Or if you want a single function:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(require 'magit)

(defun ar/magit-soft-reset-head~1 ()
  "Soft reset current git repo to HEAD~1."

id: fischers-london-yes-but

## Yes

Step into a Viennese blast from the past. Beautiful setting and pleasant vibe. Ordered a dirty martini on the rocks, a bottle of Merlot, Käsespätzle (with bacon), and Wiener Schnitzel (with anchovy/capers/egg). All very tasty.

## But…

Surprisingly, desserts (Topfenstrudel, Berggasse and coffee) were nothing spectacular. Also not a cheap eat (£50 per person).

# \[2016-01-20 Wed\] Chocolate fondant recipe
---
id: chocolate-fondant-recipe
---

My girlfriend recently made a delicious chocolate fondant. Saving the [The Guardian's recipe](http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/feb/10/how-cook-perfect-chocolate-fondants):

## Ingredients (2 servings)

-   60g unsalted butter, cut into dice, plus extra to grease
-   1 tbsp cocoa powder
-   60g dark chocolate, broken into pieces
-   1 egg and 1 egg yolk
-   60g caster sugar
-   1 tbsp plain flour

## Preparation

1.  Pre-heat the oven to 200C if cooking immediately, and put a baking tray on the middle shelf. Butter the inside of 2 small ramekins or pudding moulds, and then put the cocoa in one and turn it to coat the inside, holding it over the second mould to catch any that escapes. Do the same with the other mould.
2.  Put the butter and chocolate into a heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a pan of simmering water and stir occasionally until melted. Allow to cool slightly.
3.  Vigorously whisk together the egg, yolk, sugar and a pinch of salt until pale and fluffy. Gently fold in the melted chocolate and butter, and then the flour. Spoon into the prepared moulds, stopping just shy of the top – at this point the mixture can be refrigerated until needed, or even frozen, as the puddings will not wait around once cooked.
4.  Put on to a hot baking tray and cook for 12 minutes (14 if from cold, 16 if frozen) until the tops are set and coming away from the sides of the moulds. Leave to rest for 30 seconds and then serve in the ramekins or turn out on to plates if you're feeling confident – they're great with clotted cream or plain ice cream.

# \[2016-01-12 Tue\] Import UIKit for simpler debugging

id: import-uikit-for-simpler-debugging
---

I bookmarked [An \@import-ant Change in Xcode](http://furbo.org/2015/05/11/an-import-ant-change-in-xcode/) and immediately forgot about it. The gist is to import UIKit to simplify inspecting objects during an lldb session:

``` example
(lldb) expr @import UIKit
```

Shorten typing by creating aliases in \~/.lldbinit:

``` example
command alias uikit expr @import UIKit
command alias foundation expr @import Foundation
```

Miss C-a, C-e in your browser and other Linux apps? You can enable the GTK Emacs key theme:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-key-theme "Emacs"
```

or if on Cinnamon:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
$ gsettings set org.cinnamon.desktop.interface gtk-key-theme Emacs
```

If your desktop environment is not running gnome-settings-daemon, start it with:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
$ gnome-settings-daemon
```

# \[2016-01-08 Fri\] Emacs Objective-C completion with Irony
---
id: emacs-objective-c-completion-with-irony

## Install libclang on Mac

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install llvm --with-clang
```

## Configure Emacs

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(use-package irony :ensure t
  :config
  (add-hook 'objc-mode-hook 'irony-mode)
  (add-hook 'irony-mode-hook 'irony-cdb-autosetup-compile-options))

(use-package company-irony :ensure t

  (add-hook 'irony-mode-hook 'company-irony-setup-begin-commands))
```

## install irony server

Run:

``` example
M-x irony-install-server
```

NOTE: Needs libclang: Install with "brew install llvm –with-clang" By default, irony-install-server did not find libclang on Mac OS. *irony-install-server* invokes cmake for you. Work around by adding:

``` example
-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/Users/your-user-name/homebrew/opt/llvm
```

For example:

``` example
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/Users/your-user-name/homebrew/opt/llvm -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX\=/Users/your-user-name/.emacs.d/irony/ /Users/your-user-name/.emacs.d/elpa/irony-20160106.1223/server && cmake --build . --use-stderr --config Release --target install
```

## Compilation database

### Install xctool

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install xctool
```

### Generate compilation database

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
xctool -sdk iphonesimulator -arch x86_64 -scheme SomeScheme -reporter pretty -reporter json-compilation-database:compile_commands.json clean build

# \[2016-01-03 Sun\] Gandhi's ever-contemporary wisdom
---
id: gandhis-ever-contemporary-wisdom
---

From [Gandhi: Radical Wisdom for a Changing World](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gandhi-Changing-Mohandas-Karamchand-published/dp/B015GRZTP2):

## Anger

"I do get angry, but I feel angry with myself for it. Full conquest of anger is possible only through self-realization. We should love even those who have the worst opinion of us. This is ahimsa, the rest is only ignorance."

## Bad handwriting

"I am now of opinion that children should first be taught the art of drawing before learning how to write. Let the child learn his letters by observation as he does different objectives, such as flowers, birds, etc., and let him learn handwriting only after he has learned to draw objects."

## Conduct of the Ashram

"Service without humility is selfishness and egotism."

## Eating

"There is a great deal of truth in the saying that man becomes what he eats. The grosser the food, the grosser the body."

## Heart

"There are chords in every human heart. If we only know how to strike the right chord, we bring out the music."

## Moral law

The law of truth and love.

## Renouncing or forgoing

Nishkulanand sings: "Renunciation of objects, without the renunciation of desires, is short-lived, however hard you may try."

## Silence

"Man spoils matters much more by speech than by silence."

## Time

"Every minute that runs to waste never returns. Yet, knowing this, how much time do we waste?"

## The palate

"Turn to the birds and beasts, and what do you find? They never eat merely to please the palate, they never go on eating till their inside is full to overflowing. And yet, we regard ourselves as superior to the animal creation!"

## Vow of Swadeshi

"The person who has taken the vow of swadeshi will never use articles which conceivably involve violation of truth in their manufature or on the part of their manufacturers."

3.  Exercise, sleep, and 90 minute work bursts.
4.  Incomplete tasks prompt healthy thinking out of context.
5.  Time off or stepping back is invaluable.
6.  Genuinely help were most successful/enjoyable.
7.  Plan for saying no while highlighting priority and seeking feedback.
8.  Measure important behavior change.

# \[2015-12-30 Wed\] Find in \$PATH with type and which
---
id: find-in-path-with-type-and-which

I typically use *which* to figure out the first binary found in \$PATH:

``` {.bash org-language="sh" results="output" exports="both"}
which -a emacsclient
```

``` example
/Users/user/homebrew/bin/emacsclient
/usr/bin/emacsclient
```

I always forget about *type* though:

``` {.bash org-language="sh" results="output" exports="both"}
type -a emacsclient
```

``` example
emacsclient is /Users/user/homebrew/bin/emacsclient
emacsclient is /usr/bin/emacsclient
```

## Global vs local package installation location

> {prefix}/lib/node_modules

vs

> path/to/project/node_modules

## View npm config

``` {.bash org-language="sh" results="output" exports="both"}
npm config list
```

``` example
; cli configs
user-agent = "npm/2.14.2 node/v4.0.0 darwin x64"

; node bin location = /Users/user/.nvm/versions/node/v4.0.0/bin/node
; cwd = /Users/user/stuff/active/blog
; HOME = /Users/user
; 'npm config ls -l' to show all defaults.

```

## Get config value

``` {.bash org-language="sh" results="output" exports="both"}
npm config get prefix
```

``` example
/Users/user/.nvm/versions/node/v4.0.0
```

## Set config value

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
npm config set prefix=$HOME/some/location
```

## Install package globally

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
node install --global <package-name>
```

or

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
node install -g <package-name>
```

## List global packages

``` {.bash org-language="sh" results="output" exports="both"}
npm list --global
```

You can also use –depth=0 to make less verbose.

``` example
/Users/user/.nvm/versions/node/v4.0.0/lib
├─┬ babel-eslint@4.1.3
│ ├── acorn-to-esprima@1.0.4
│ ├─┬ babel-core@5.8.25
│ │ ├── babel-plugin-constant-folding@1.0.1
│ │ ├── babel-plugin-dead-code-elimination@1.0.2
...
```

## Install local package

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
npm install <package-name> --save
```

–save will add \<package-name\> dependency to your package.json.

## package.json

See [using a package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json).

## Uninstall package

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
npm uninstall <package-name>
```

## Install package at version

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
npm install <package-name>@1.7.0
```

## Search packages

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
npm search linter
```

Following up from [changing CWD with helm projectile](#change-emacs-shells-cwd-with-helm-projectile), here's a way to search your bash history with helm:

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/search-bash-history-with-emacs-helm/helm-bash-history.gif)

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(defun ar/helm-helm (title candidates on-select-function)
  "Helm with TITLE CANDIDATES and ON-SELECT-FUNCTION."
  (helm :sources `((name . ,title)
                   (candidates . ,candidates)
                   (action . ,on-select-function))
        :buffer "*helm-exec*"
        :candidate-number-limit 10000))

(defun ar/shell-send-command (command)
  "Send COMMAND to shell mode."
  (assert (string-equal mode-name "Shell") nil "Not in Shell mode")
  (goto-char (point-max))
  (comint-kill-input)
  (insert command)
  (comint-send-input))

(defun ar/helm-shell-search-history ()
  "Narrow down bash history with helm."
  (interactive)
  (assert (string-equal mode-name "Shell") nil "Not in Shell mode")
  (ar/helm-helm "bash history"
                (with-temp-buffer
                  (insert-file-contents "~/.bash_history")
                  (reverse
                   (delete-dups

# \[2015-12-19 Sat\] View DICOM files from your X-ray
---
id: view-dicom-files-from-your-x-ray
---

Got a CD with my chest X-ray from the hospital. Was expecting a pdf or an image of sorts, but the CD content was rather different. For starters, it was targeted at Windows users (AUTORUN.INF, MediaViewerLauncher.EXE and a bunch of DLLs):

``` text
$ find . -exec file --mime-type '{}' \;

./AUTORUN.INF: text/plain
./DICOMDIR: application/dicom
./MediaViewerLauncher.EXE: application/octet-stream
...
./Libraries/BASEPRINTER.DLL: application/octet-stream
./Libraries/CDDATABURNER.DLL: application/octet-stream
./Libraries/COM.DLL: application/octet-stream
...

./DICOM/PAT_0000/STD_0000/SER_0000/OBJ_0001/IM_0001: application/dicom
./DICOM/PAT_0000/STD_0000/SER_0001/OBJ_0001/ED_0001: application/dicom
./DICOM/PAT_0000/STD_0000/SER_0002/OBJ_0001/ED_0001: application/dicom
./Worklist/ClinicalInfo/067eccde-b299-e511-9114-005056ad3afe.mht: text/html
./Worklist/Report/067eccde-b299-e511-9114-005056ad3afe.mht: text/html
./Worklist/Worklist.wl: application/octet-stream
```

I'm on a Mac, so most of these files were not useful to me. The more interesting files were IM_0001 and ED_0001 with "application/dicom" MIME type. [DICOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM) files stand for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine. How to view these on a Mac? [OsiriX viewer](http://www.osirix-viewer.com/Downloads.html) is an option. OsiriX, though on the heavy side (100.7MB download), it rendered the X-ray successfully.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/view-dicom-files-from-your-x-ray/2015-12-03-osirix-x-ray-small.png)

Unsurprisingly, ImageMagick's [convert](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php) utility also handles DICOM files. Converting to PNG worked well.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
$ convert ./DICOM/PAT_0000/STD_0000/SER_0001/OBJ_0001/ED_0001 ED_0001.png
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/view-dicom-files-from-your-x-ray/2015-12-03-imagemagick-x-ray-small.png)

DICOM files also hold patient's metadata and optional reports. The file format is [well known](http://cabiatl.com/mricro/dicom/index.html). OsiriX gives you access to it, but a few lines of python can also extract it for you. First install the [pydicom](https://github.com/darcymason/pydicom) package:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
$ sudo pip install pydicom
```

Running the python interpreter is enough to peek at the metadata:

``` python
>>> import dicom
>>> ds = dicom.read_file("./DICOM/PAT_0000/STD_0000/SER_0000/OBJ_0001/IM_0001")
>>> ds
```

There were other DICOM files with a report:

$ tar xf dcmtk-3.6.0.tar.gz
$ cd dcmtk-3.6.0
$ cmake .
$ make
```

Or installed via homebrew:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
$ brew install dcmtk
```

DCMTK includes dcmdump. You can use it to dump DICOM files:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
$ dcmdata/apps/dcmdump DICOM/PAT_0000/STD_0000/SER_0000/OBJ_0001/IM_0001
```

JCS, from [Irreal](http://irreal.org/blog), recently [highlighted](http://irreal.org/blog/?p%3D4777) fuco's [dired-hacks](https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks). [dired-subtree](https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks/blob/master/dired-subtree.el) is super handy for drilling subdirectories down. Bound \<tab\> and \<backtab\> to toggle and cycle subtrees.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(use-package dired-subtree :ensure t
  :after dired
  :config
  (bind-key "<tab>" #'dired-subtree-toggle dired-mode-map)

# \[2015-12-07 Mon\] Playing with Dart's analysis server
---
id: playing-with-darts-analysis-server

Dart SDK ships with an [analysis server](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/master/pkg/analysis_server). Very handy if you'd like to write a completion plugin for your favorite editor. The API is well [documented](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/master/pkg/analysis_server/doc/api.html). Of interest, there's [LocalDartServer.java](https://github.com/tomsontom/dartedit/blob/master/bundles/at.bestsolution.dart.server.api/src-gen/at/bestsolution/dart/server/api/internal/local/LocalDartServer.java), part of [dartedit](https://github.com/tomsontom/dartedit/blob/master/bundles/at.bestsolution.dart.server.api/src-gen/at/bestsolution/dart/server/api/internal/local/LocalDartServer.java).

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
$ dart path/to/bin/snapshots/analysis_server.dart.snapshot  --sdk=path/to/dart-sdk
```

NOTE: The server reads requests from standard input. Either escape or execute the following as one-liner json requests.

``` json
{
  "id": "1\n",
  "method": "analysis.setAnalysisRoots\n",
  "params": {
    "included": [
      "path/to/your/dart/project"
    ],
    "excluded": []
  }
}
```

``` json
{
  "id": "3\n",
  "method": "completion.getSuggestions\n",
  "params": {
    "file": "path/to/some/file.dart\n",
    "offset": 673
  }
}
```

Gave [Spaceline](https://github.com/TheBB/spaceline/) a try. [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs)'s powerline theme. Setup was super simple (Thanks [Eivind Fonn](https://github.com/TheBB) and [Sylvain Benner](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs)):

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(use-package spaceline :ensure t
  :config
  (use-package spaceline-config
    :config
    (spaceline-toggle-minor-modes-off)
    (spaceline-toggle-buffer-encoding-off)
    (spaceline-toggle-buffer-encoding-abbrev-off)
    (setq powerline-default-separator 'rounded)
    (setq spaceline-highlight-face-func 'spaceline-highlight-face-evil-state)
    (spaceline-define-segment line-column
      "The current line and column numbers."
      "l:%l c:%2c")
    (spaceline-define-segment time
      "The current time."
      (format-time-string "%H:%M"))
    (spaceline-define-segment date
      "The current date."
      (format-time-string "%h %d"))
    (spaceline-toggle-time-on)
    (spaceline-emacs-theme 'date 'time))

Spotted [Conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/index.html) package manager. It handles python installations, in addition to package management. There's also a package index provided by [Binstar](https://binstar.org/). Installed [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html), the bare bones Conda environment.

Can't find a python package in Binstar? Here's a post on [Using PyPi Packages with Conda](http://www.peterbronez.com/Using%2520PyPi%2520Packages%2520with%2520Conda). If that fails, you can try pip from your Conda python environment.

If using Emacs shell and helm projectile, you can wire these up to quickly change your current working directory.

My Bosch washer/dryer (WKD28350GB) stopped drying recently. Resetting the dryer's thermostat red breaker did the trick.

# \[2015-09-26 Sat\] Soundcloud's Go best practices (GopherCon 2014)
---
id: soundclouds-go-best-practices-gophercon-2014
---

Having watched the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DY1-RLAl7iOI), some takeaways:

## Single GOPATH

### \$GOPATH/src/github.com/soundcloud/foo

## Repo structure

### github.com/soundcloud/whatever

1.  README.md

2.  Makefile

3.  main.go

4.  support.go

5.  foo

    1.  foo.go

    2.  bar.go

6.  whatever-server

    1.  main.go

7.  wharever-worker

    1.  main.go

## Formatting and style

### Use gofmt.

### Google's codereview [guidelines](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).

### Avoid named return parameters.

### Avoid make and new (unless you know sizes).

### Use struct{} for sentinel values: sets, signal chans.

1.  Conveys no information in it this part.

2.  Instead of empty interface.

3.  instead of boolean.

### Break long lines at parameters

1.  No need to compact.

2.  Keep trailing coma in last argument.

### Flags

``` go
func main() {
  var (
    foo = flags.String("foo\n", "doch\n", "...")
    bar = flat.Int("bar\n", 34, "...")
  )
  flag.Parse()
  // ...
}
```

### Logging

1.  package log

2.  Telemetry

3.  Push model (gets expensive over time)

    1.  Graphite

    2.  Statsd

    3.  AirBrake

4.  Pull model (chosen)

    1.  expvar

    2.  Prometheus

### Testing

1.  package testing

    1.  Unit tests

    2.  reflect.DeepEqual

2.  Integration

    1.  Use flags for starting services

    2.  // +build integration

### Code validation

1.  On Save

    1.  Go fmt

    2.  Go import (go fmt++)

2.  On Build

    1.  Go vet

    2.  Golint

    3.  Go test

3.  On Deploy

    1.  go test -tags=integration

4.  GoCov?

### Dependency management

1.  Unimportant projects

    1.  go get -d (and hope)

2.  Important

    1.  VENDOR (ie. copy into your repo)

        1.  Git submodules (no!).

        2.  Git subtrees (seem OK).

        3.  Tool (godep?).

        4.  Build

        5.  For binaries (use \_vendor subdir)

# \[2015-09-23 Wed\] Sync pip with Mac OS updates
---
id: sync-pip-with-mac-os-updates
---

My pip installation recently broke after a Mac OS update.

``` example
$ pip
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/bin/pip\n", line 5, in <module>
    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/pkg_resources.py\n", line 2793, in <module>
    working_set.require(__requires__)
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/pkg_resources.py\n", line 673, in require
    needed = self.resolve(parse_requirements(requirements))
  File "/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/pkg_resources.py\n", line 576, in resolve
    raise DistributionNotFound(req)
pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: pip==1.1
```

Updating my pip installation fixes the break:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
$ sudo easy_install -U pip
```

# \[2015-09-20 Sun\] Chinatown treats review
---
id: chinatown-treats-review
---

## Recommended? yep

There's a corner in Chinatown hosting some truly superb treats. If you get caught in the rush between Newport court and Newport place, you'd likely fail to notice some the awesome street food stands.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chinatown-treats/chinatown.jpg) ![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chinatown-treats/newport-court.jpg)

## Chilly squid

I've walked past this place many times and never noticed it. They serve a handful of items, but the grilled chilly squid skewers caught my attention. They're grilled, brushed with chilly sauce and finished with sprinkled sesame and cumin seeds. Super tasty.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chinatown-treats/squid-stand.jpg)

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chinatown-treats/chilly-squid-1.jpg) ![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chinatown-treats/chilly-squid-2.jpg)

## Pancake + Crisp + Egg + Hot chillies = Jiān Bǐng 煎餅

I first had these delicious breakfast savory pancakes at a Beijing street food stall. Never expected to randomly find Jiān Bǐng in London. It's a crepe with an additional egg spread, hoisin sauce, chilly sauce, hot chillies, topped with spring onions and coriander, all wrapping a wonderfully crispy bread cracker. And.. it's awesome.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chinatown-treats/pancake-3.jpg)

## Tai Yaki

Chinatown Bakery is hard to miss. Pedestrian traffic slows down as we all fall under the spell of the Tai Yaki machine. This wonderful assembly line produces fish-shaped sweet waffles filled with custard. They are the perfect dessert after some savory street snacks. You can get a bag of 4 for £2.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chinatown-treats/fish-1.jpg) ![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chinatown-treats/fish-4.jpg)

## All near each other

All these delights are within a stone's throw away from each other.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/chinatown-treats/pano.png)

## Useful?

Was this post useful to you? do [reply](https://twitter.com/xenodium/status/646101779281801216)!

## Better suggestion?

London is full of overhyped, gimmicky, and unnecessarily expensive restaurants. Very few deliver truly awesome food (even those expensive ones). Got suggestions? I'd love to hear from you [\@xenodium](https://twitter.com/xenodium).

# \[2015-09-08 Tue\] Lucky 7 review
---
id: lucky-7-review
---

## Recommended? yep

[Lucky 7](http://www.lucky7london.co.uk) is a small nostalgic American diner on Westbourne Park road. I like the vibe, the space, and the unpretentious waiting staff. I go to Lucky 7 often enough, originally for the buttermilk pancakes, but the list of favorites on the menu keeps growing.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/lucky-7-review/lucky-7-menu-board.jpg) ![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/lucky-7-review/lucky-7-staff.jpg)

Smileys by [w.dyer](https://openclipart.org/detail/219291/smile).

## Buttermilk Banana pancakes

These are my favorite pancakes in London by far. Banana buttermilk pancakes and a few free coffee refills usually sort me out until dinner time. Add a side of bacon if extra hungry. You probably don't need it though.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/lucky-7-review/lucky-7-coffee.jpg) ![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/lucky-7-review/lucky-7-pancakes.jpg)

## Reuben sandwich

The reuben has been on Lucky 7's specials menu for months now. Not had many of these in London, but compared to The Brass Rail's, this reuben was a clear winner. The sandwich is huge and comes with fries. My girlfriend and I struggled to finish one between the two of us.

![](http://localhost:8787/alvaro/lucky-7-review/lucky-7-reuben-fries.jpg "1")

![](http://localhost:8787/alvaro/lucky-7-review/lucky-7-reuben-cross-section.jpg "1")

## Vanilla milkshake (add malt!)

This milkshake hits the spot every time, but it's filling. You almost have to decide between the shake and an actual meal. If you must have it, add malt. Sorry, no picture.

## Huevos Rancheros

This is a breakfast dish I can equally make (better?) at home, but Lucky 7 wins hands down every time I'm feeling particularly lazy. Sorry, no picture.

## Useful?

Was this post useful to you? do [reply](https://twitter.com/xenodium/status/643139264302186497)!

## Better suggestion?

London is full of overhyped, gimmicky, and unnecessarily expensive restaurants. Very few deliver truly awesome food (even those expensive ones). Got suggestions? I'd love to hear from you [\@xenodium](https://twitter.com/xenodium).

# \[2015-08-14 Fri\] Upgrading PL30 headphones
---
id: upgrading-pl30-headphones

I've loved my [Soundmagic PL30 in-ear headphones](http://www.amazon.com/Soundmagic-PL30-In-Ear-Headphones/dp/B001MQ3CCO). They're relatively inexpensive, comfortable, and great for exercising (they stay in). Audio quality and bass have been good enough (I don't need much). Unfortunately, I've had two pairs of PL30's and both stopped working after a year or two. I'm replacing the last pair with [RHA's MA750](http://www.amazon.co.uk/RHA-MA750-Isolating-In-Ear-Headphone-Black/dp/B00ELAM8LE) (an upgrade, me hopes).

Other contenders considered: [Etymotic Research HF5](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Etymotic-Research-Portable-iPhone-Earphones-Black/dp/B000XPG2QI), and [Shure SE215](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Shure-SE215-In-Ear-Isolating-Earphones-Clear/dp/B004U9NH3E). Also considered bluetooth alternatives like [JayBird BlueBuds X](http://www.amazon.com/JayBird-BlueBuds-Sport-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B00AIRUOI8?) and [Plantronics BackBeat GO 2](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Plantronics-BackBeat-Wireless-Earbuds-Frustration-Black/dp/B00DZTHW9U).

I'm somewhat nervous to pay more for a pair of headphones. Let's hope they don't meet the same unfortunate fate. We'll see.

# \[2015-07-23 Thu\] Add site-specific browsers to your workflow
---
id: add-site-specific-browsers-to-your-workflow
---

There are three browser tabs continously used in my workflow: GMail, Google Calendar, and Google Play Music. I normally have many more tabs open, but these three I access periodically. As the number of open tabs increases, and I fail to cleanup, getting back to my usual three gets a little trickier.

So far, I've kept each of these services open in separate windows. But that doesn't always work. Click on any link in your inbox and you're back to playing cleanup. This is where [site-specific browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site-specific_browser) (SSB) can help.

[Epichrome](https://github.com/dmarmor/epichrome) enables you to build Chrome-based SSBs (on Mac OSX). Build an SSB for the usual suspects and easily jump to them using the app switcher.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/add-site-specific-browsers-to-your-workflow/switcher-small.png)

UPDATE: Enable the Chrome extension to open URLs in default browser.

Whether it's Makefile, SConstruct, BUILD, or your favorite build file, chances are you have to tweak it from time to time. `ar/open-build-file` searches your current and parent directories to find a build file.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}

(defun ar/parent-directory (path)
  "Get parent directory for PATH."
  (unless (equal "/" path)
    (file-name-directory (directory-file-name path))))

(defun ar/find-upwards (path filename)
  "Search upwards from PATH for a file named FILENAME."
  (let ((file (concat path filename))
        (parent (ar/parent-directory (expand-file-name path))))
    (if (file-exists-p file)
        file
      (when parent
        (ar/find-upwards parent filename)))))

(defun ar/open-closest (filename)
  "Open the closest FILENAME in current or parent dirs (handy for finding Makefiles)."
  (let ((closest-file-path (ar/find-upwards (buffer-file-name)

    (when closest-file-path
      (message closest-file-path)

    closest-file-path))

(defun ar/open-build-file ()
  "Open the closest project file in current or parent directory.

id: recognize-new-password-prompts-in-emacs-shell

At some point, you may come across a trusted command-line utility prompting you for a password, and Emacs shell happily displaying each typed character to the nearby-world to see. Luckily, you can train Emacs to recognize new password prompts and hide the typed characters in modes deriving from comint. Append the password prompt REGEXP:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(setq comint-password-prompt-regexp (concat comint-password-prompt-regexp
                                            "\\|"
                                            "Password for red alert:"))

# \[2015-07-09 Thu\] mp4 to gif
---
id: mp4-to-gif

Converting mp4 to gif is handy for posting short screencasts. You can convert to gif using ffmpeg and optimize with imagemagick. To install:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
apt-get install ffmpeg imagemagick (linux)
brew install ffmpeg imagemagick (Mac)
```

Convert to gif:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
ffmpeg -i my.mp4 -pix_fmt rgb24 -r 5 my.gif
```

Optimize with:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
convert -dither none -layers Optimize my.gif my_optimized.gif
```

UPDATE: There's also licecap and subsequently optimize with:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
cat source.gif | gifsicle --colors 256 --optimize=3 --delay=15 > target.gif
```

UPDATE: [Also consider for .mov](https://gist.github.com/dergachev/4627207):

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
ffmpeg -i in.mov -pix_fmt rgb24 -r 10 -f gif - | gifsicle --optimize=3 --delay=3 > out.gif

# \[2015-07-03 Fri\] Fishing with Emacs

id: fishing-with-emacs
---

OK not quite, but having recently learned about [C-M-w (append-next-kill)](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Appending-Kills.html), I used it in a keyboard macro to fish out matching lines. This is similar to [flush-lines](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Other-Repeating-Search.html), except the kill ring is also populated. This is handy, if you need the flushed lines. Here's an example.

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/fishing-with-emacs/fishing.gif)

Here's the equivalent in Emacs lisp:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(defun flush-kill-lines (regex)
  "Flush lines matching REGEX and append to kill ring.  Restrict to \
region if active."
  (interactive "sFlush kill regex: ")
  (save-excursion
    (save-restriction
      (when (use-region-p)
        (narrow-to-region (point) (mark))
        (goto-char 0))
      (while (search-forward-regexp regex nil t)
        (move-beginning-of-line nil)
        (kill-whole-line)))))

# \[2015-06-30 Tue\] Searchable ebooks in Emacs
---
id: searchable-ebooks-in-emacs
---

If you haven't bought [Mastering Emacs](https://www.masteringemacs.org/book) by [Mickey Petersen](https://twitter.com/mickeynp), you should. It's a wonderful source of Emacs tips. Having just finished the ebook on my Kindle, I was keen to go back and fish out some of that newly found wisdom. My immediate reaction was to figure out a way to make the ebook searchable from Emacs.

The ebook is available in epub and pdf format. Though Emacs's docview is super handy for viewing pdf's, searching didn't feel as comfortable as searching in org mode. The epub, on the other hand, proved useful. [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org) can easily convert from epub to org.

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
pandoc  --from=epub --to=org mastering-emacs.epub > mastering-emacs.org
```

After a some tidying (mostly removing BEGIN_HTML/END_HTML blocks and adding TITLE/AUTHOR), the resulting org file is surprisingly clean and easy to search/navigate. [helm-swoop](https://github.com/ShingoFukuyama/helm-swoop) and [helm-org-in-buffer-headings](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/blob/199b9feb396eedc0e502dd767b19060f7dc09f6a/helm-org.el) are great for that.

# \[2015-04-30 Thu\] Programmatic iOS Auto Layout
---
id: programmatic-ios-auto-layout
---

Basic iOS auto layout usage. See [Adopting Auto Layout](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/AdoptingAutoLayout/AdoptingAutoLayout.html) and [Visual Format language](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/VisualFormatLanguage.html) for reference.

``` objc
- (instancetype)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame {
  self = [super initWithFrame:frame];
  if (self) {
    // Disable autoresizing mask translation for parent.
    self.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = NO;

    _subview1 = [[UIView alloc] init];
    // Disable autoresizing mask translation for subview.
    _subview1.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = NO;

    _subview1.backgroundColor = [UIColor redColor];
    [self addSubview:_subview1];

    // Creates a dictionary of bindings to be used in visual format.
    NSDictionary *viewBindings = NSDictionaryOfVariableBindings(_subview1);

    // H: horizontal layout
    // |-50- spacing in relation to superview
    // [_subview1(==50)] subview1's width
    [self addConstraints:[NSLayoutConstraint constraintsWithVisualFormat:@"H:|-50-[_subview1(==50)]"
                                                                 options:0
                                                                 metrics:nil
                                                                   views:viewBindings]];
    [self addConstraints:[NSLayoutConstraint constraintsWithVisualFormat:@"V:[_subview1(==50)]"
                                                                 options:0
                                                                 metrics:nil
                                                                   views:viewBindings]];
  }
  return self;
}
```

## Also consider:

-   A UIView Subclass should implement intrinsicContentSize.
-   A UIView Subclass should never add constraints on neither itself (ie. self) nor superview.

# \[2015-04-17 Fri\] Plantuml example
---
id: plantuml-example

Played with [Plantuml](http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/PlantUML_Language_Reference_Guide.pdf). Convenient for generating UML diagrams from text. Here's the [Language Reference Guide](http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/PlantUML_Language_Reference_Guide.pdf). Here's an example:

``` {.plantuml exports="both" file="images/plantuml-example/plantuml-singer.png"}
@startuml
  abstract class Singer {
    abstract void sing()
    void Dance()
  }

  skinparam monochrome true
  Singer <|-- PopSinger
  Singer <|-- SalsaSinger

  class PopSinger {
    void sing()
  }

  class SalsaSinger {
    void sing()
  }

@enduml
```

![](https://xenodium.github.io/images/plantuml-example/plantuml-singer.png)

Install plantuml on Mac OS X:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
brew install plantum
```

Generating diagram:

``` {.bash org-language="sh"}
$GRAPHVIZ_DOT=~/homebrew/bin/dot java -jar path/to/plantuml.8018.jar diagram.plantuml
```

ps. Installation and verification [gist](https://gist.github.com/NLKNguyen/c39596c205ba1f1866c8).

Venturing into Emacs lisp and [Helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm). Here's a go at listing all URLs in current buffer.

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(require 'goto-addr)

(defun ar/helm-buffer-url-candidates ()
  "Generate helm candidates for all URLs in buffer."
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (let ((helm-candidates '())
          (url))
      (while (re-search-forward goto-address-url-regexp
                                nil t)
        (setq url
              (buffer-substring-no-properties (match-beginning 0)
                                              (match-end 0)))
        (add-to-list 'helm-candidates
                     (cons url
                           url)))
      helm-candidates)))

(defun ar/helm-buffer-urls ()
  "Narrow down and open a URL in buffer."
  (interactive)
  (helm :sources `(((name . "Buffer URLs")
                    (candidates . ,(ar/helm-buffer-url-candidates))
                    (action . (lambda (url)

# \[2015-03-22 Sun\] Resetting variables using defvar
---
id: resetting-variables-using-defvar
---

Want to re-evaluate defvars and modify variables? eval-defun (bound to C-M-x) can help. From the manual:

> If the current defun is actually a call to \`defvar', then reset the variable using its initial value expression even if the variable already has some other value. (Normally \`defvar' does not change the variable's value if it already has a value.) Treat \`defcustom' similarly.

-   Use nreverse and nconc to operate on lists in-place.
-   Set buffer local variables:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(setq-local my-clever-var)
```

-   Execute before saving buffer:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(add-hook 'write-file-hooks
          (lambda ()
            (message "about to save!")))
```

-   Possibly use to start processes and send file content:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(make-comint NAME PROGRAM &optional STARTFILE &rest SWITCHES)
```

-   Creating markers:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(setq my-marker (copy-marker (point)))
  #<marker at 10251 in *ielm*>

(marker-buffer my-marker)
  #<buffer *ielm*>

(marker-position my-marker)
  10251 (#o24013, #x280b, ?⠋)
```

-   Get org heading at point:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(org-get-heading 'no-tags 'no-todo)
```

-   Remove string text properties. From manual:

> (substring-no-properties STRING &optional FROM TO)
>
> Return a substring of STRING, without text properties. It starts at index FROM and ends before TO. TO may be nil or omitted; then the substring runs to the end of STRING. If FROM is nil or omitted, the substring starts at the beginning of STRING. If FROM or TO is negative, it counts from the end.

-   Skip org entry metadata/drawers:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(org-end-of-meta-data-and-drawers)
```

-   Random access to org entry using id (or CUSTOM_ID):

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(org-open-link-from-string "[[#%exciting-custom-id]]")
```

-   From [Debugging Elisp Part 1: Earn your independence](http://endlessparentheses.com/debugging-emacs-lisp-part-1-earn-your-independence.html):

> -   Go to where the function is defined.
> -   Press C-u C-M-x. Edebug breakpoint for function.
> -   Invoke function in question.
> -   n/c will get you around.
> -   q when done.

-   Pretty printing objects:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(let ((my-var (list "val1"
                    "val2"
                    "val3")))
  (pp-to-string my-var))
```

-   Search and/or replace in curent buffer:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(re-search-forward "needle"
                   nil t)
(match-beginning 0) ;; Start location of match from last search.
(match-end 0) ;; End location of match from last search.
(replace-match "love")

;; needle-in-haystack
```

-   Restrict buffer editing to a region:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(narrow-to-region (point)
                  (point-max))
```

-   Restore restriction:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(save-restriction (narrow-to-region (point)
                                    (point-max))
```

-   Restore point, mark, and current buffer:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}
(save-excursion (goto-char (point-max))
                (insert "Hello elisp."))
```

-   Concatenating strings:

``` {.commonlisp org-language="emacs-lisp"}

# \[2015-04-23 Thu\] Emacs key bindings and maps
---
id: emacs-key-bindings-and-maps
---

## based on [masteringemacs.org](http://www.masteringemacs.org/article/mastering-key-bindings-emacs).

## bonus tip

prefix key, followed by c-h, lists keys in prefix.

## keymap

maps key to action.

## keymap found in buffer and most major modes.

## keys

-   undefined: self explanatory.
-   prefix key: ie. c-x (part of complete key).
-   complete key: complete input executes associated command.

## mapping

-   (define-key keymap key def): add to current buffer map.
-   (local-set-key key command): add to active buffer (no map option).
-   (local-unset-key key)
-   (global-set-key key command): add to global keymap (all buffers).
-   (global-unset-key key)

## key codes

-   kbd: macro transaltes human-readable key to emacs readable.
-   function and navigation keys must be surrounded by \<\>.
-   example: (kbd "c-c p") or (kbd "\<f8\>") of (kbd "\<down\>").

## remapping

-   use remap to replace mapping (ie. kill-line with my/kill-line).
-   (define-key keymap \[remap original-function\] 'my-own-function).

## reserved keys

-   "c-c ?" generally reserved for you, but third party packages use it.
-   function keys (ie. f1-f12).
-   hyper and super (ancient).

## lookup order

-   in a nutshell: minor mode keys, local keys, global keys.
-   full order:
    1.  overriding-terminal-local-map: terminal-specific key binds.
    2.  overriding-local-map: override all other local keymaps (avoid if possible).
    3.  char property at point: useful for yasnippet.
    4.  emulation-mode-map-alists: advanced multi-mode keymap.
    5.  minor-mode-overriding-map-alist: minor modes in major modes.
    6.  minor-mode-map-alist: as previous (preferred for minor modes) \<—–
    7.  current-local-map: buffers current local map.
    8.  current-global-map: last place to look (ie. global).

## mode hooks

-   (local-set-key (kbd "c-c q") 'my-awesome-method)) in hook-method.
-   for key-chord-define, use current-local-map.

-   Prefer exceptions over assertions.
-   Throw ValueError for wrong input.
-   Return explicit False if remaining case is always false.

  <h2>Bring org to your iPhone</h2>
  <br/>
  built with 💙 by <a href="http://xenodium.com">me</a> - powered by <a href="https://orgmode.org">org 🦄</a>
</center>
<br>
<br>

## Why?

[Org mode](https://orgmode.org) on [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs) is wonderful. I'm a big fan and use it regularly on my laptop. As an iPhone user, I wanted **quick access to my org files while on the go**... so [I built](https://xenodium.com/org-habits-on-ios-check-tasks-youre-next) **Plain Org** for iOS.

## Feature requests / Bugs
Please file bugs or feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/plainorg/plainorg/issues).
<br>
<br>

## What is org?
[Org](https://orgmode.org) is a powerful plain text markup similar to markdown. It supports a wide range of features and is compatible with any text editor (Emacs, Vim, VSCode, etc.).
<br>
<br>
### Sample Org Snippet

```org
#+TITLE: My iPhone stuff

* Inbox
** DONE [#A] Publish Plain Org to App Store   :plainorg:
** NEXT [#B] Make [[https://xenodium.com/oatmeal-cookie-recipe][oatmeal cookies]] :cooking:

[[file:oats.jpg]]

** TODO [#A] Document unicorn sighting        :research:truth:
- [X] Talk to eyewitness.
- [X] /Flesh/ _out_ ~evidence~ =table=

| last seen | location       | country  |
|-----------+----------------+----------|
|     2017  | The Royal Mint | Scotland |
|     1991  | Harz Mountains | Germany  |
```
<br>
<br>

## Syncing your data
Plain Org uses iOS [File Provider extensions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/fileprovider) and relies on third parties to do the actual syncing. If your favorite cloud service offers an iOS extension, Plain Org can likely open, edit, and sync your data.

Your mileage may vary creating new files or opening local links. These may not be possible using your provider's extension.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

### Enabling Sync
See iOS's [using third-party apps in Files](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102238) to enable syncing data with your cloud service.
<br>
<br>
## Paid app
Plain Org is a paid app. At present, it is not <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html">FOSS</a>. This may change in the future, but it is not something I can currently offer. I understand this may not be ideal for all, but hope there's partial relief in implementing a well-known text markup (ie. no vendor lock-in). Please help support its development if you can. Ping me if you need a free copy. Email me at "plainorg" + "@" + "xenodium.com".
<br>
<br>

## FAQ

### Can I use custom keywords?

Yes. Plain Org recognizes [per-file](https://orgmode.org/manual/Per_002dfile-keywords.html) keywords. That is, in the org file itself, you can specify both active and inactive keywords. You can the following to an existing org file:

```
#+TODO: TODO STARTED BLOCKED | DONE CANCELLED
```

Note: Keywords on the left hand side of the "|" are considered active while those on the right are inactive.
<br>
<br>

### How do I sync my org files?
Depends on provider. See [Syncing your data](#syncing-your-data).
<br>
<br>

### What kind of links are supported?

#### HTTP(S) Links

```
https://plainorg.com
http://plainorg.com
[[https://plainorg.com][Plain Org]]
```

#### `id:` links (across files)

To resolve id links, Plain Org needs granted access to a directory. When an id link is opened, the app searches the owning directory for other org files that may contain the id that's linked to. The following snippet shows a sample snippet:

Note: Not all syncing providers support granting access to a directory. Without this, Plain Org is unable to resolve id links.

##### Documents/bar.org

```
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: 90daa47c-3d6b-4d94-bf78-18d776c431c1
:CREATED: [2021-09-28 Tue 09:02]
:END:
#+TITLE: Bar

* TODO Review [[id:e4453d79-227f-4a78-bf04-9bdff5e4675f][Foo]]
```

##### Documents/foo.org

```
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: e4453d79-227f-4a78-bf04-9bdff5e4675f
:CREATED: [2021-09-28 Tue 09:02]
:END:
#+TITLE: Foo

* Some heading
* Another heading
```

#### file: links

To resolve file links, Plain Org needs granted access to a directory. When an file link is opened, the app tries to access the referenced file within the owning directory. If the linked file is an image and is accessible, Plain Org renders it inline. For others, like pdfs, they are opened in a modal screen.

Note: Not all syncing providers support granting access to a directory. Without this, Plain Org is unable to resolve file links.

##### File structure

```
Documents/report.org
Documents/subdir/image.png
Documents/subdir/foo.org
Documents/subdir/document.pdf
```

##### Documents/report.org

```
[[file:subdir/foo.org][Foo]]
[[file:subdir/image.png]]
[[file:subdir/document.pdf]]
```

Note: Relative link resolution requires the org file's owning directory (i.e. Documents) to be a parent of the linked file.

##### Unsupported

```
 [[file:../Desktop/foo.org][Foo]]
```

  <h2>Form and track positive lasting habits</h2>
  <br/>
  built with 💙 by <a href="http://xenodium.com">me</a> - powered by <a href="https://orgmode.org">org 🦄</a>
</center>
<br>
<br>

## Why

Keeping habits accessible and trackable has helped me form good habits. I built an app to remove friction from the tracking process, so I could increase the likelihood of sticking with it all.

I'm not a habits expert, but got inspired by James Clear's [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits). Read that book if you're interested in the topic. No affiliation here, just a great book.
<br>
<br>

## What

You can track any positive habit you'd like to form or maintain. Some examples: exercising, watering the plants, reading, making your bed, taking your meds, calling grandma, doing yoga, drinking water, meditating, doing push-ups, flossing, taking your vitamins, eating fruit,practicing a language, playing an instrument...
<br>
<br>

## How

Friction is one of the bad guys playing against ya when it comes to adopting and sticking with habits. Same applies to the tracking process itself. Remove friction wherever possible.

*Did your habit today? Mark it done.*

I tried to make Flat Habits simple and focused (I use it myself). Marking habits done should be quick and frictionless. Keep the streak going and [don't break the chain](https://jamesclear.com/stop-procrastinating-seinfeld-strategy).
<br>
<br>

## Don't

Flat Habits focuses solely on re-enforcing positive habits. Their benefits compound over time, but only if you regularly put in the work. If you don't exercise frequently, you don't get the health and fitness benefits. If you don't water the plants, they die.

*Don't let your todos compete and win over your habits*

Keeping habits separate from my long list of todos has been helpful for me. Habits are the good things I must do for myself every day. No postponing allowed because "I have too many other things on my TODO list".
<br>
<br>

### Privacy first

Flat Habits stores your habit data on your iPhone as a plain text file. You can view, edit, or migrate your data at any time (use export from the menu).

*Flat Habit does not connect to any servers at all*

Optionally, you can save your habits to a shared location or cloud (if that's your preference), so you can access habit data from multiple devices/apps.
<br>
<br>

### Org text

At its core, Flat Habits stores all data to a text file, using [org plain text markup](https://orgmode.org/).

You can use [your favorite editor](http://xenodium.com/frictionless-org-habits-on-ios) (Emacs, Vim, VSCode, etc.) to poke at Flat Habits data.

```

<br>
<br>

### Get in touch

User the feedback menu option from the app or email flathabits *at* xenodium.com.
<br>
<br>

### Privacy policy

No personal data is sent to any server, as there is no server component to this app. There are neither third party server integrations, accounts, analytics, advertising, nor hidden trackers in this app. All your data is kept on your iPhone, unless you choose a cloud provider to sync or store your data. See your cloud provider's privacy policy for detailson how they may handle it.

If you choose to send feedback by email, you have the option to review and attach logs to help diagnose issues. If you'd like an email thread to be deleted, just ask.

### Plain Org

I'm an [Org mode](https://orgmode.org/) fan, so I wrote [Plain Org](https://plainorg.com) to view and edit org files from iOS. Also on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1578965002).


## \*scratch\*

I wanted an Emacs-inspired \*scratch\* buffer on iOS (who doesn't?), so I built [\*scratch\*](https://xenodium.com/scratch-a-minimal-scratch-area/).

## macOS

- Command line utils like [macosrec](https://github.com/xenodium/macosrec).
- Take care of your eyes on macOS with [Fresh Eyes](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fresh-eyes/id6480411697?mt=12).

## Emacs

- [emacs.tv](https://emacs.tv) - Check out the [source](https://github.com/emacstv/emacstv.github.io).

## Privacy first

By default, all notes and media are stored on your iPhone, entirely offline.
<br>
<br>
## A familiar interface

Browse your entries chronologically through a familiar micro-blogging-like feed (similar to [Twitter](https://twitter.com), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social), or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app)).

Save notes or journal entries as you would post to any of these familiar services.

With Journelly, your data is yours and remains fully offline.
<br>
<br>
## iCloud syncing (optional)

While Journelly is offline by default, you may optionally sync with other devices via iCloud.

Folks have reported using [Working Copy](https://workingcopy.app), [Sushitrain](https://github.com/pixelspark/sushitrain), or [Möbius Sync](https://mobiussync.com) for syncing, though your mileage may vary. As of v1, I can only offer iCloud as the officially supported provider.
<br>
<br>
## No lock-in (org plain text)

Journelly stores your entries as a plain text file, using [org markup](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-syntax.html) to structure things.

If you're unfamiliar with [org markup](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-syntax.html), no worries. It's just what's under the hood. Journelly offers a familiar interface to interact with your entries.

If you're still curious, this is what the marked-up text looks like:

## Markdown is coming, want it sooner?

Journelly's plain text format isn't surfaced to app users and is kept as an implementation detail. While many users are happy to just use the app without thinking about internals, others may be keen to poke at its plain text file from their beloved editors. Today, Journelly is powered by [org markup](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-syntax.html), but it will support Markdown in the future.

Please [register your interest](mailto:journelly+markdown@xenodium.com?subject=I'm%20interested%20Markdown%20for%20Journelly&body=Just%20want%20to%20register%20my%20interest%20in%20Markdown%20support%20for%20Journelly.). The more requests I get, the sooner I'll get Markdown support out the door.

## Journelly v1 is only the beginning

I've got lots of wonderful feature requests in the pipeline. While I would have loved to squeeze more features into v1, I really needed to manage scope to be able to make its first launch. Having said that, v1 is only the beginning. I'm looking forward to bringing new features in. Many of them I really want for myself!

<br>

## Features

I hope you find Journelly frictionless, simple, and intuitive to use. Please let me know if there are ways it can improve by reaching out through the app's feedback menu.

No personal data is sent to any server, as there is no server component to this app. There are neither third-party server integrations, accounts, analytics, advertising, nor hidden trackers in this app. All your data is kept on your iPhone unless you choose a cloud provider to sync or store your data. See your cloud provider's privacy policy for details on how they may handle it.
